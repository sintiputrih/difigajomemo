In the early parts of their relationship, they lived with Jimi’s manager and his girlfriend in Montagu Square.</p><p>However, they were forced to move owing to the racial prejudices of the time and the “rock-and-roll lifestyle” that people tended to frown upon.</p><p>The couple, alongside their previous flatmates, then moved to Berkeley Square. This living arrangement was short-lived, and they finally moved to 23 Brook Street in Mayfair.</p><p><strong>Also Read: </strong>Meet Ed Sheeran Two Kids With His Wife Cherry Seaborn, Family And Ethnicity</p><p>This place of their dwelling now functions as a museum.</p><p>The two continued to live there until they broke up.
