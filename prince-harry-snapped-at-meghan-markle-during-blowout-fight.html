<time>22 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p class=p1>Writing about the good times — and bad.<a href=#><strong> Prince Harry</strong></a> recalled a blowout fight with wife <a href=#><strong>Meghan Markle</strong></a> in <a href=#>his&nbsp;<i>Spare&nbsp;</i>memoir</a>,&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>can exclusively reveal.</p><p class=p1>“Maybe the wine went to my head. Maybe the weeks of battling the press had worn me down. For some reason, when the conversation took an unexpected turn, I became touchy,” the Duke of Sussex, 38, <a href=#>wrote in his debut memoir</a>, which is set for a Tuesday, January 10, release. “Then angry. Disproportionately, sloppily angry.”</p><p class=p1>In&nbsp;<i>Spare</i>, Harry alleged that the 41-year-old&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Suits</a>&nbsp;</i>alum had said something that <a href=#>he “took the wrong way” due to a cultural difference and a language barrier</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/prince-harry-snapped-at-meghan-markle-during-blowout-fight-01.jpg><p class=p1>“I was also just over-sensitive that night. I thought: ‘Why’s she having a go at me?’ I snapped at her, spoke to her harshly [and] cruelly,” the England native wrote of his wife, <a href=#>whom he married in May 2018</a>. “As the words left my mouth, I could feel everything in the room come to a stop. The gravy stopped bubbling, the molecules of air stopped orbiting. Even Nina Simone seemed to pause.”</p><p class=p1>The former Hallmark actress — who shares <a href=#>son Archie, 3, and daughter Lilibet, 19 months,</a> with Harry — swiftly walked out the room, with the duke thinking she disappeared for a “full 15 minutes” before he found her sitting alone in their bedroom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/prince-harry-snapped-at-meghan-markle-during-blowout-fight.jpg><p class=p1>“She was calm, but said in a quiet, level tone that she would never stand for being spoken to like that. I nodded. She <a href=#>wanted to know where it came from</a>,” Harry <a href=#>wrote in&nbsp;<i>Spare</i></a>, remembering their conversation. “I don’t know. [She asked,] ’Where did you ever hear a man speak like that to a woman? Did you overhear adults speak that way when you were growing up?’ I cleared my throat, looked away [and responded], ‘Yes.’”</p><p class=p1>While the “Archetypes” podcast host has not publicly addressed the duo’s fight, Harry revealed that she told him that she <a href=#>would not “tolerate” a partner — or coparent —</a> who yelled like he did that night. “She <a href=#>wasn’t going to raise children in an atmosphere of anger or disrespect</a>. She laid it all out, super-clear,” the BetterUp CIO wrote.</p><p class=p1>Harry further noted that both he and Meghan — who <a href=#>stepped back from their positions as senior working royals</a> in 2020 — “knew” his outburst was not caused by their conversation.</p><p class=p1>“It came from somewhere deep inside, somewhere that needed to be excavated, and it was obvious that I could use some help with the job,” Harry explained before referencing brother <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a>. “‘I’ve tried therapy,’ I told her. ‘Willy told me to go. Never found the right person.’ [It] didn’t work. ‘No,’ she said softly. ‘Try again.’”</p><p class=p1>Harry has long been <a href=#>a fervent advocate of therapy</a> and discussing his mental health. “The moment I started doing therapy, it opened my eyes,” he previously said <a href=#>during an October 2022 appearance at the Masters of Scale Summit</a>. “I was moving through life thinking there was only one way to live. And therapy burst that bubble. … All of a sudden, I realized that now I have perspective and a great understanding of my value. I regained confidence that I never thought I had.”</p><p class=p1>While the former military pilot has found growth in discussing his emotions, he has alleged that his older brother <a href=# rel>once mocked his anxious tendencies</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I was an agoraphobe. Which <a href=#>was nearly impossible given my public role</a>. After one speech, which couldn’t be avoided or canceled, and during which I’d nearly fainted, Willy came up to me backstage. Laughing,” Harry claimed in&nbsp;<i>Spare</i>. “‘Harold! Look at you! You’re drenched.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The Eton College alum further remembered that <a href=#>he “couldn’t fathom” that his sibling would react</a> in such a way, especially since the 40-year-old Prince of Wales <a href=#>had witnessed Harry’s first panic attack</a>. William has not publicly addressed Harry’s allegations.</p><p class=p1><i>Spare&nbsp;</i>will be released on Tuesday, January 10.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapqpmjsKZ5x5qpq7FdqLuivM%2Bem2aZpGK6prPHmqVmpZGnuK2xjJ2sq6GenHqjuM6wpq6sXZu2qLTTaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fprince-harry-snapped-at-meghan-markle-during-blowout-fight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fprince-harry-snapped-at-meghan-markle-during-blowout-fight.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fprince-harry-snapped-at-meghan-markle-during-blowout-fight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fprince-harry-snapped-at-meghan-markle-during-blowout-fight.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fprince-harry-snapped-at-meghan-markle-during-blowout-fight.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fprince-harry-snapped-at-meghan-markle-during-blowout-fight.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./richard-holton.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./richard-holton.html>Richard Holton</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./will-madison-kill-charlie-fear-the-walking-dead.html>Madison Could Be out for Blood When She Returns to 'Fear the Walking Dead'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./will-madison-kill-charlie-fear-the-walking-dead.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
