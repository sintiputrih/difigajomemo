Cote moved to New York City after graduating, to find work as an actress, working as a waitress in an Indian restaurant in Manhattan and an Italian eatery in Brooklyn to support herself.</p><p>de Pablo picked up parts in the New York City Public Theater, on the TV show All My Children, and in commercials. She played the role of Marguerite Cisneros in The Jury (broadcast on the Fox Network). The show was short-lived, screening only 10 one-hour episodes. De Pablo was about to make her Broadway debut in 2005, in The Mambo Kings as Dolores Fuentes, but the show closed after a short trial run in San Francisco.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cote-de-pablo-cancer></span><span>Cote de Pablo Cancer</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cote de Pablo shared the story of her cancer scare with the CDC’s Inside Knowledge campaign to encourage women to take charge of their health by listening to their bodies, talking to their doctor about unusual symptoms, and staying up-to-date on getting regular Pap tests, as recommended by their doctor.</p><p>She had little time left to dedicate to her health, between working hard and enjoying time with her family and friends. As much as the former NCIS actress knew it was time for a Pap test, life just kept getting in the way of Cote’s visit to the doctor. She stated that, by the time she was tested, things didn’t look too good, they thought she might have cervical cancer.</p><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 93,000 women in the United States get some form of gynecologic cancer each year, whether it’s cervical, or one of the four other main types of gynecologic cancer (uterine, ovarian, vaginal, vulvar).</p><p>Cote was lucky enough to be not one of those women. But her test results were a wake-up call that getting regular Pap tests needed to move higher up on her priority list — for both her and her family’s sake. She added, “I’ve always been very close to my mother. When we finally got good results, she broke down,”. “That’s when I realized: It’s not just about me. It’s about your loved ones, too.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=cote-de-pablo-ncis></span>Cote de Pablo&nbsp;<span>NCIS</span><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Cote de Pablo is well known for her portrayal of Ziva David, an Israeli Mossad officer turned NCIS agent, in the police procedural drama NCIS.

De Pablo was nominated for the same award in 2008 and 2009. In 2008 and 2009, also she was nominated for an ALMA Award for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Television Series.

However, in the season 13 finale of the series, it was stated that De Pablo’s character had apparently died in an explosion in Israel.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=cote-de-pablo-and-michael-weatherly></span>Cote de Pablo and Michael Weatherly<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Network executives arranged for Cote de Pablo to act alongside series regular Michael Weatherly to test for chemistry during her second audition; he went off script by brushing her hair back and commenting, “You remind me of Salma Hayek”.

Donald Bellisario, the producer, met with De Pablo Afterwards, as she was waiting for a cab to take her back to the airport, telling her she had landed the part.</p><p>De Pablo described the character as someone who was completely different from anyone else on the show because she has been around men all her life, she was used to men of authority and she was not afraid of men.</p><p>Deadline announced on August 28, 2018, that de Pablo and former NCIS castmate, Michael Weatherly, would be the executive producers of the upcoming CBS detective drama MIA, written by Shepard Boucher.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cote-de-pablo-life-after-ncis></span><span>Cote de Pablo Life After NCIS</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>De Pablo was announced to have been cast in the film The 33 in January 2014, about the 2010 Copiapó mining accident, as the wife of one of the miners.
