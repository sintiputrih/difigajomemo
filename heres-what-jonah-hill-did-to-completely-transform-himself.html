Jonah Hill is a comedic film actor and producer who starred in films such as Knocked Up, <a href=#>Superbad</a>, 21 and 22 Jump Street, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, How To Train Your Dragon and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He was a plus-size actor since he'd been in Hollywood, but recently, Jonah Hill has put his health first and dramatically changed his life. He is now what one would call "zen." Hill has disappeared for a while, like he does sometimes, and comes back better than ever.</p><p>But don't worry, <a href=#>he isn't quitting acting. </a>Hill is just taking some time to better himself, so he can be the best person and actor he can be.</p><p>From his weight to his style to <a href=#>how he lives his day to day life</a>, here's how Jonah Hill dramatically changed his life.</p><h2 id=reflecting-on-his-twenties><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Reflecting On His Twenties</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He had a personal evolution between his twenties and thirties. His overnight success led him to "have too much power and not enough life skills." His fame happened overnight, and he never got a chance to finish college, like his friends, and live a normal life. "I didn’t realize until I turned 30 that what those four years gave all my friends was this wobbling period of how to be a person. I was really advanced professionally but really behind personally. All my 20s, I wasn’t really looking inward. I was just running toward success. Or trying to find success," he said in a recent interview with GQ.</p><p>When he was in his 20s, he would let people be brutal to him and would even treat himself badly because he wasn't sure of his own value. “I sucked at skateboarding. But I would throw myself down 10 stairs to make my friends laugh, knowing I couldn’t ever do any trick that would be good,” he explained. “Or in comedy, I would be brutal to myself, or allow brutality to me, because I felt like that was my seat at the table."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jonah-hill-on-working-out-every-day><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jonah Hill On Working Out Every Day</span></h2><p>Since 2017, Jonah Hill has been working on getting fit and results are definitely showing. He believed he could get better roles if he slimmed down and debuted his new look after his role in Moneyball. Every morning he has a workout routine, and sometimes he even stops in the morning for a smoothie before hitting the gym.</p><p>The actor found a nutritionist and personal trainer to help him in his weight-loss journey. The nutritionist had him eating fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains and lean protein. He also incorporates a lot of sushi into his diet and eliminated alcohol. Hill also exercises regularly. He started with jogging, sit-ups and push-ups and worked his way up to more strenuous workouts. He saw results quickly and got a huge boost of self-confidence as a result.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Little Revealing Facts Jonah Hill Wants To Keep On The DL</a></span></p><h2 id=his-style-and-look><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>His Style And Look</span></h2><p>Many people would describe his new style as Zen. Hill grew an enormous beard and got a bunch of new tattoos, including one about body positivity. Hill started wearing star-shaped sunglasses and vintage mushroom t-shirts. He even dyed his hair blonde. Hill even said the word "dude" 9 times in a recent interview.</p><h2 id=jonah-hill-has-taken-up-surfing><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jonah Hill Has Taken Up Surfing</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another way Jonah Hill likes to work-out is by surfing. He has gotten really into surfing lately and is even dating a surfing instructor. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a video with GQ,</a> talking about 10 things he can't live without, Hill admits he makes himself surf every day. He will get up at 7 am, and if the weather is good, he will go out and do it again in the evening just to take a break from work. He is not professional, but if he keeps it up, and we think he will, maybe he'll be in the Olympics in a few years.</p><p>As for the girlfriend, Sarah Brady is a surf instructor in LA, and she seems to make him very happy. According to her social media, besides teaching surfing, Brady also dabbles in photography and works with ocean protection charities.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> 20 Little Known Facts About Jonah Hill's Sister: Beanie Feldstein</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=focusing-on-his-mental-health><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Focusing On His Mental Health</span></h2><p>He no longer thinks you have to be miserable to be a good artist. "I got healthier, my art got better and I was happier," he told GQ. Jonah Hill goes to therapy and even made a documentary on his therapist. Joaquin Phoenix recommended to the actor that he should start therapy. The 37-year-old meditates daily.</p><p>Hill is focusing so much on his mental health that he confessed to the creator of Succession, who is the interviewer and frequent collaborator, Adam McKay, that he cannot binge the show. It lets too much negative stuff into his brain.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Photos Showing How Much Jonah Hill Has Changed In The Last 15 Years</a></span></p><h2 id=he-limits-his-time-on-social-media><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Limits His Time On Social Media</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jonah Hill compares social media to smoking, saying there are both killers of time. In a cover story interview with GQ, went on to explain himself. "So, Instagram. Instagram -as I smoke a cigarette - is the cigarettes of this time. It is the biggest killer. It is death. And I fully participate in it, like I smoke cigarettes." He says he has to have very limited interaction with it, but he isn't dissing anyone who uses the app.</p><h2 id=jonah-hill-does-not-caring-what-other-people-think><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jonah Hill Does Not Caring What Other People Think</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the interview, Hill also shared that he talked with his late 92-year-old neighbor, who put a lot into perspective. "I said, 'What's the deal, man? You're the happiest guy I've ever seen in my life. Why are you so f------ happy? And he's like, 'I don't look around at what anybody else is doing. I just live my life, and I don't look at what other people are doing.'" He went on to call him his hero, the answer inspired him so much.</p><h2 id=what-jonah-hill-is-up-to-now><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Jonah Hill Is Up To Now</span></h2><p>Jonah Hill is spending every day making a better life for himself, surfing with his girlfriend, hanging out on the beach and with his nephews and cuddling with his dog. Besides posting pictures about his life, Hill is also a great supporter of his sister's career also. Beanie Feldstein has starred in Booksmart, Lady Bird, Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He still writes and directs and gets all of his projects in order. Hill is living a very quiet lifestyle at the moment.
