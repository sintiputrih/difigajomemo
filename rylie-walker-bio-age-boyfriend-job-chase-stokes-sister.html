What are the odds?</p><p style=text-align:left>Baby sister Rylie had apparently surprised him during filming in South Carolina. The fact is, Chase’s post had led some people on his IG to wrongly assume Rylie as his new love interest following his breakup with his co-star Madelyn Cline in 2021.</p><p style=text-align:left>That being established, here’s a tell-all about Chase Stokes’s sister Rylie Walker.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Meet Rylie Walker, Chase Stokes Sister</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Rylie Walker is Chase Stokes’s half-sister. She shares the same father with him.</p><p style=text-align:left>First, Chase was born on 16 September 1992 in&nbsp;Annapolis, Maryland. He is the only child of Jeff Stokes and Jennifer Canning. His parents then divorced when he was several months old.</p><p style=text-align:left>Infant Chase naturally moved with his mother to Atlanta, Georgia, and later to Orlando, Florida as a teenager. Sometime in the process of growing up, both his parents got married to other spouses. And that is how Rylie came along, from Chase’s dad’s second marriage.</p><p style=text-align:left>Rylie has an additional sibling born from both her parents, therefore a full sibling. It is her “genius baby brother” Griffin Walker, who in Rylie’s words despite being younger is wiser. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in June 2021.</p><p>Then there are Kaden Stokes and Kendall Nicole as well, Chase’s half-siblings, younger brother, and younger sister, with whom he has the same mum.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Does Rylie Walker Have A Boyfriend?</strong></h3><p>Rylie Walker has reportedly been dating Lewis Scattergood, a soccer player.</p><p>Lewis could not be found on Rylie’s social media and also no details of their relationship were understood as of the time of this writing.</p><p>So, for now, let us share with you some facts about Rylie’s alleged boyfriend. Unlike Rylie, Lewis was born and bred in his hometown of Nottinghamshire, England. The athletic man played soccer during high school at Outwood Academy Valley and later in college as well. Speaking of his educational background, the above 6-foot-1-inch 2022 Men’s Soccer Roster took a Sports Business major at college.</p><h3><strong>Rylie Walker Age</strong></h3><p>Rylie, with the full name Nora Mae Rylie Walker, was reportedly born in 2000.

So, on LinkedIn, she also introduced herself as an experienced, hands-on retail salesperson with a demonstrated history of working in multiple industries. She also marked sustainability practices, environmental awareness and advocacy, marine biology, laboratory and research applications, and political ecology, as her skills.</p><p>(Of course) some of the media outlets also addressed her as a model.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Is Rylie Walker On TikTok?</strong></h3><p>Rylie Walker could be found on TikTok <a href=#>@ryliewalk</a>. However, she did not share much on it and also did not have many followers.

Here, she basically appears to be a nature</span> enthusiast.

While her hometown is <span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>Florida’s Orlando. Then, in a story about Chase, reporters claimed that his father, stepmom, and siblings </span>still reside in Maryland.</p><p style=text-align:left>Chase, on the other hand, had moved to Los Angeles, California with his then-girlfriend in 2017.
