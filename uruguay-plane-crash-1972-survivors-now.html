On Oct. 13, 1972, Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 crashed in the Andes mountains. It was chartered by the Old Christians Club rugby team to take their players, friends, and family members from Montevideo, Uruguay, to Santiago, Chile, for an exhibition match.</p><p>But what actually happened changed the <a href=#>40 passengers and five crew members’ lives forever</a>. The plane made an emergency landing in Mendoza, Argentina, due to bad weather on Oct. 12. It set flight again the next day, but when the pilot misjudged his location, the plane began descending before it was out of the Andes, crashing and sliding down a mountain into a valley.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>A still from Netflix's 'Society of the Snow'</p></figure><p>Twelve people died in the initial crash, and six more died in the following week due to the freezing temperatures and their injuries. This left 27 survivors, many of whom were injured. Search efforts failed to spot them because of how they blended in with the snow, so efforts were halted after a few days as everyone was presumed dead. After 72 days, there were only 16 survivors who made it out. Where are they now?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Many of the 1972 Uruguay plane crash survivors are alive, well, and speaking about their experiences.</h2><p>For the first time ever, the 16 survivors have allowed their names (and their fellow deceased passengers’ names) to be used in a film or series. While Yellowjackets is loosely based on the events of the 1972 plane crash, and the 1993 film Alive is basically a retelling of the events, Society of the Snow is the first film to directly reference what actually happened with the involvement of the survivors.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>A still from Netflix's 'Society of the Snow'</p></figure><p>Survivor Roberto Canessa told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Time</a>, “If we didn't get ourselves out, we were all going to die." He explained how the group had to resort to cannibalism to stay alive, but that director J.A. Bayona tells this story in a way that addresses the generosity and humanity of what happened, rather than the horror. Now, Roberto and his fellow survivors get to finally share their story with the world.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Three of the survivors were instrumental in saving the others by venturing out to try to find civilization.</h2><ul><li><strong>Roberto Canessa</strong> played by Matías Recalt, is now 70 years old.
