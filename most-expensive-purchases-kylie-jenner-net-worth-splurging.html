She is officially the youngest self-made billionaire. The youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner siblings amassed her fortune from engaging in numerous ventures.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of her very first incomes was from the family’s reality TV show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians. She has starred in the show since its premiere in 2007. In 2012, she started a clothing line with her sister Kendall. In between her appearances on the show and running her clothing line, Kylie also endorsed products and collaborated with various companies to promote different products.</p><p>In 2015, she launched a makeup line, Kylie Lip Kits that changed to Kylie cosmetics a year later. By 2018, Kylie cosmetics had sold $630 million worth of merchandise. Towards the end of 2019, Kylie sold off 51% of Kylie cosmetics to Coty, an American cosmetic company, for $600 million. With a $1.2billion fortune, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie can buy pretty much whatever her heart desires</a>.</p><p>Here are some crazy expensive purchases the makeup mogul has made in recent years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-real-estate-investments><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><strong>Her Real Estate Investments</strong></span></h2><p>Kylie recently purchased a $36.5 million brand new house in Holmby Hills, California and it is massive. The property was retailing for about $45 million but the makeup mogul managed to get a huge discount on the home. The house has 7 bedrooms, 14 baths, and 20 parking spaces. Furthermore, just this year, she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bought five acres of land in Hidden Hills</a> for $15 million. Kylie has spent millions purchasing properties in the last few years.</p><h2 id=her-numerous-luxurious-cars><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>Her Numerous Luxurious Cars</strong></span></h2><p>The youngest of the Kardashian family likes to travel in style. She has an impressive car collection that includes a Bentley Bentayga that retails for about $229,000. Kylie also owns a $125,000 Mercedes-Benz G Class Wagon, which has an orange wrap that matches her $400,000 Lamborghini Aventador. She also has a Ferrari that is estimated to be worth $250,000 and several luxury Rolls Royce vehicles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-does-not-do-commercial-flights><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><strong>She Does Not Do Commercial Flights&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><p>Kylie Jenner does not fly on commercial planes. She has her own means of air travel. The young billionaire owns <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a private jet that cost about $1 million</a>. When she does not want to use her jet, Kylie can cough up to $60k on airfare. She once rented a jet, customized it in baby pink, and branded it KYLIESKIN. This must have cost her a fortune.</p><h2 id=baby-girl-stormi-s-necessities><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><strong>Baby Girl Stormi’s Necessities</strong></span></h2><p>Kylie spares no expense when it comes to her daughter. Stormi has been enjoying a life of luxury since she was born in 2018. Before she was born, her mother went on a $70,000 shopping spree to buy her baby essentials, which included designer shoes, clothes, and strollers. Stormi also owns a luxurious collection of rides among them a $400 mini Louis Vuitton Lamborghini.</p><h2 id=her-beau-s-many-and-expensive-gifts><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>Her Beau’s Many And Expensive Gifts</strong></span></h2><p>Kylie loves splurging on her man. Before she hooked up with Travis, Kylie dated rapper Tyga whom she bought two cars. Baby daddy Travis Scott is also spoiled rotten with expensive gifts. Kylie has gifted this father of one expensive jewelry, designer clothes, and luxurious vacations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Things You Probably Didn’t Know About Kylie Jenner’s Exes</a></span></p><h2 id=momager-kris-handsome-salary><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Momager Kris' Handsome Salary</strong></span></h2><p>Kylie has amassed a big empire and she needs help managing it. One of the most trusted people she has working for her is her mother. However, her services are not free of charge. Kris is paid a 10% management fee. Kris’s management fee once accumulated to $17 million in a year.</p><h2 id=her-expensive-wardrobe><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>Her Expensive Wardrobe</strong></span></h2><p>Kylie’s Instagram account is one of the most followed social media pages in the globe. Kylie and her famous sisters are fashion trendsetters. That said, she always has to look her best. We highly doubt there is a famous designer that has not dressed Kylie. Some of her favorite designers include Balmain, Gucci, Channel, and LV.</p><h2 id=her-numerous-designer-bags-that-cost-a-fortune><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Her Numerous Designer Bags That Cost A Fortune</strong></span></h2><p>Kylie’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">purse collection deserves its own post</a>, and here is why. The fashionista has over 400 bags, which sit in their own closet away from her other three clothes closets. Her favorite bags are the Hermes Birkin bags, and they occupy a whole row. Kylie’s most expensive bag is a white Himalayan croc skin Hermes that costs a jaw-dropping $432,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stormi Is Already Worth $3 Million: How Kylie Jenner's Daughter Amassed Her Wealth</a></span></p><h2 id=the-parties-she-throws><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>The Parties She Throws</strong></span></h2><p>Kylie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">does not hold back when it comes to parties</a>. For Stormi’s first birthday, Kylie threw a Stormi-themed party that cost as much as a lavish wedding. Travis has also gotten similar treatment. For his 26th birthday, Kylie rented Six Flags in Los Angeles, which set her back about $150,000.</p><h2 id=her-expensive-jewelry><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Her Expensive Jewelry&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><p>Kylie rarely steps out without jewelry. One of her most expensive pieces is a $53,000 Rolex watch she bought for herself. She has also spent several thousands of dollars on Cartier bracelets and rings. Kylie also owns a $7,000 diamond ring. She does not flaunt her jewelry but it is rather apparent that she has an expensive stash.</p><h2 id=hair-stylish-hair-extensions><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Hair Stylish Hair Extensions</strong></span></h2><p>For her 21st birthday, Kylie had a Barbie-themed party. To look the part Kylie had on a 400g blonde hair extension, which normally ranges between $6000 and $8000. Kylie also wears her hair in different styles and colors. She has to make use of wigs to achieve these styles. Her regular wigs cost about $600 but they can go up to $5,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s What Kendall And Kylie Jenner Look Like Without Any Makeup On</a></span></p><h2 id=her-lip-fillers><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Her Lip Fillers</strong></span></h2><p>Kylie has admitted to getting lip fillers. She has not always had the full lips she has today and has to have the procedure done every two to three months, which is not cheap. A 50-minute procedure costs roughly between $1,900 to $3,900. This means that Kylie spends about $23,000 per year on her lips.</p><h2 id=her-fresh-manicures><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Her Fresh Manicures</strong></span></h2><p>Another area, Kylie does not mind coughing up the dough on is her nails. She always has long beautiful manicured nails and like everything else she wears, they do not come cheap. Kylie utilizes the services of an LA manicurist by the name Britney Tokyo who charges an average of $125 for a two-hour sesh. She also charges an additional $50 for house calls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-adorable-puppies><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Her Adorable Puppies</strong></span></h2><p>Before Kylie had Stormi, she liked spending time with her greyhounds Bambi, Norman ad Sophia. Depending on the breed, such pooches can cost anywhere between $1,000 and $4,000. On Stormi’s first birthday, she adopted Wesley a breed between a Chihuahua and Dachshund. Kylie and her former boyfriend were also parents to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Merle English bulldog that they got for $50,000</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life Of Kylie: 15 Things We Hope To See In Season 2</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">therichest.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cheatsheet.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">etonline.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikqKukYrK5vMSnqqKulWK9tr7CoZisnaNiuLq4yJ5ko52eo7Kzec2eq2avn6fBqXnSqaOuqpeeu6h7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmost-expensive-purchases-kylie-jenner-net-worth-splurging.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmost-expensive-purchases-kylie-jenner-net-worth-splurging.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmost-expensive-purchases-kylie-jenner-net-worth-splurging.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmost-expensive-purchases-kylie-jenner-net-worth-splurging.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmost-expensive-purchases-kylie-jenner-net-worth-splurging.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmost-expensive-purchases-kylie-jenner-net-worth-splurging.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./julian-javier-net-worth-241759.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./julian-javier-net-worth-241759.html>Julian Javier Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./benicio-bryant.html>Benicio Bryant - Bio, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Career, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./benicio-bryant.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
