If you were to come to my home, you would probably be surprised at the number of vitamins and herbs in my kitchen!</p><p>Let me take you back to December. We all know the holidays can be extremely busy and filled with holiday parties and neighbor goodie plates. It is usually the time of year we neglect our own health!</p><p>It was Christmas Eve and after a busy night of prepping for the day ahead, I finally laid down on my pillow to finally get some sleep. I was beyond exhausted. My life had been a whirlwind the past two months and my body was paying the price. I kept myself so busy that I had completely neglected my own personal health. I felt sick and exhausted. My typical mind-body wellness habits were out the window.</p><p>I stayed awake for awhile, jotting down all of my ideas on how I was going to get back on track. I didn’t feel good and I wanted a change. I couldn’t wait to rediscover the amazing feeling I get when I focus on taking care of my body and mind.&nbsp; I made a goal to begin taking my vitamins and herbs daily, to workout 5 days a week, to get better sleep, and to eat whole foods. I am here to tell you that those little changes have made a world of difference in how I feel.</p><h2><span>I am sharing ways to keep your immune system healthy and strong.</span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Ways-to-Boost-Immune-System.-Emergen-C-at-Kroger-stores.jpg alt="Emergen-C at Fry's.

Boost your Immune System.</strong></span></h2><p>Keeping your immune system healthy and strong during this time of year is especially important.&nbsp; &nbsp;My Dad worked for 45 years before retiring and rarely ever took a “sick day” He always tells me that he has his “secret weapons.” As soon as he begins to feel sick, he takes a good amount of Vitamin C, Zinc, and Echinacea. Kroger stores sell Emergen-C and I always make sure we have some on hand. I have been able to keep sicknesses at bay this Winter by taking these vitamins at the first sign of illness. By taking these vitamins, it is a great way to boost your immune system.</p><h2><span><strong>What does Zinc do?</strong></span></h2><p>It is an effective natural cold remedy and boosts the immune system. It helps the immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses. It also acts as an anti-inflammatory agent.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/How-to-Keep-the-Immune-System-Healthy-and-Strong.-Vitamin-C-from-Kroger-stores.jpg alt="Ways to Keep Your Immune System Healthy and Strong.

Move your body.&nbsp;</span></h2><p>Another way we keep our family of six healthy and strong is to work out together. My oldest daughter always says, “<span><strong>the family that works out together, stays together.</strong></span>” It is a little family joke but whenever we are on vacation, we work out together.&nbsp; It may be working out with some hand weights, climbing a mountain, running, or just taking a walk. We always encourage each other along the way.</p><p>My husband and I made a goal to work out together 5 times per week at 5:30 am. It isn’t easy to wake-up when it is dark outside but it feels so great once we are done. It is amazing what a workout you can get with only a set of hand weights! It has made us feel so much stronger and our mind clearer to accomplish what we need to during the day.&nbsp; Did you know that you can buy hand weights in the health department at your local Kroger store?&nbsp; I found weights varying in sizes from 3 lbs. – 15 lbs. and everything in between. Exercise can be a great immune system booster.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Ways-to-Keep-Family-Healthy-and-Strong-Kroger-Weights.jpg alt="Ways to Keep Your Immune System Healthy and Strong.

Get more SLEEP. Why is sleep so important?</span></h2><p>Another key component to staying healthy is getting enough sleep. Our bodies go into repair mode while we sleep so that is why we are more susceptible to sickness when we are tired.&nbsp; I always tell my kids as soon as they begin to feel an illness coming on to take their vitamins and get to bed.</p><p>Since we live such busy lifestyles, sometimes it is hard to get the perfect amount of sleep our body needs.&nbsp; My husband and I made it a goal to get to bed at a certain time every single night. They key is to get the body ready for sleep. I have found that Epsom Salt Baths with lavender help me relax my mind and body.&nbsp; If I am having a tough time getting to sleep, taking natural melatonin helps me sleep better.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Epsom-Salt-Bath-with-Lavender-at-Kroger-Stores.jpg alt="Why is sleep so important?

If you haven’t tried ClickList, it is such a timesaver! Find out more information about <span><a href=#>Clicklist here</a></span>.&nbsp; I also tell all of my friends about the Fry’s (it may be called Kroger, Smith’s, Ralph’s, etc) app available in the app store. It lists all of the products, prices, and location within the store of everything available in Kroger stores. I can send my daughter with a list and she knows the price and exactly where to go in the store to locate the product. It is genius!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/How-to-Keep-Immune-System-Healthy-and-Strong.jpg alt="Ways to Keep Your Immune System Healthy and Strong.
