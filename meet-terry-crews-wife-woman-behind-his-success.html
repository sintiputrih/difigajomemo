The book also touched on some of the challenges he had to overcome in the course of his life, including a traumatic childhood, the resulting anger issues and his battle with addictions.</p><p>While most of these experiences took him bouts of willpower to surpass, he admittedly owes the majority of his wins to his wife of several decades Rebecca King Crews.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Terry Crews once recalled how his wife taught him to deal with his anger issues, by helping him understand when he went overboard with his actions. Recalling the life-changing advice she gave him, Crews <a href=#>divulged</a>:</p><p><strong>“You have to understand, you’re going to lose everything. At a minimum, you’re gonna get sued. And at a maximum, someone’s going to kill you. Either the police or you come up on the wrong guy on the wrong day.”</strong></p><p>Rebecca made it clear to her husband that she and the kids still needed him, before making him promise to always walk away from violent confrontations rather than indulge his anger.</p><p>The former NFL star made that promise and has been able to live up to it with the help of some therapy and his wife’s continuous guidance. So a remarkable woman, wife and mother? What else is known about the wife of actor Terry Crews?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_The_Wife_Of_Terry_Crews></span><strong>Who Is The Wife Of Terry Crews?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Terry Crews is married to wife, <a href=#>Rebecca King-Crews</a>, a talented singer, actress, producer, TV personality and businesswoman.

Admittedly, theirs wasn’t love at first sight.</p><p>Contrariwise, Rebecca once admitted she found him too nice to a fault when they first met. As a result, she did not fancy him much and almost left him stuck in the friend zone. Luckily, he got his act together, eventually winning over the love of his life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Terry_Crews_And_His_Wife_Have_Five_Kids></span><strong>Terry Crews And His Wife Have Five Kids</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rebeca King-Crews is a mom to five amazing <a href=#>children</a>, sharing four with her husband Terry Crews.

Thanks to their resilience, the twosome have bounced back from every challenge that came their way, from Terry’s <a href=#>struggles with porn addiction</a> to Rebeca’s battle with cancer.</p><p>For Terry, marriage has not always been a bed of roses, with multiple challenges coming his way.
