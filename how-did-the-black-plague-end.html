Experts believe that the name “Black Plague” was a mistranslation of the Latin word “atra mors” which could mean either “terrible” or “black.”</p><p>It was originally estimated that on average, a third of the population of affected areas <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was wiped out</a> by the plague over its most destructive decade between 1346 and 1353, but other experts think that closer to or even over <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">half of the entire continent of Europe’s population</a> perished.</p><p>Plague victims suffered from excruciating pain. Their symptoms began with a fever and boils. A victim’s lymph nodes would swell as their body fought the infection and their skin would become strangely blotched before they began to vomit blood.</p><p>At that stage, the victim typically died within three days.</p><p>Italian chronicler Agnolo di Tura described the grisly aftermath of the Black Plague in his hometown of Tuscany:</p><p>“In many places in Siena great pits were dug and piled deep with the multitude of dead…And there were also those who were so sparsely covered with earth that the dogs dragged them forth and devoured many bodies throughout the city.”</p><p>Di Tura himself had to bury his five children because of the plague.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-271065 alt="Plague Doctor" width=600 height=819 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/plague-doctor-1.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-271065 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The flawed design of a Medieval plague doctor’s uniform did not actually protect them from infection.</span></p><p>Early researchers initially thought that the Black Plague began somewhere in China but more research has shown that it likely formed in the steppe region of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.</p><p>The first spread of the disease began, according to plague historian Ole J. Benedictow, in the autumn of 1346 when the Tartar-Mongols attacked the city of Kaffa (now Feodosiya) in Crimea.</p><p>During the siege, the Mongols catapulted plague-ridden corpses into Kaffa, effectively infecting the entire city — including the hundreds of Italian merchants who had come for trade.</p><p>In the spring, the Italians fled back home, carrying the disease on flea-ridden rats aboard with them. By early July 1347, the Black Plague had broken out all over Europe.</p><p>It quickly spread to Africa and the Middle East due to overseas trading and the growing density of cities.</p><p>Tracing the plague’s origins and spread was doable enough, but determining how the Black Plague ended is another story entirely.</p><h2>How Did The Black Plague End?</h2>The plague has affected humans for over 4,000 years, yet very little is actually known about the virulent disease.<p>Europe saw the worst of the Black Plague for nearly 10 years before the disease began to subside, yet it still returned every decade or so up until the 18th century. It was never quite as deadly as it was in the 14th century.</p><p>The Great Plague of London in 1665 is often considered the last major outbreak of the disease, though there are reports of the disease in Western Europe as late as 1721. Also, the Black Plague did continue to infect Russia and the Ottoman Empire well into the 19th century.</p><p>To this day, nobody knows exactly why or how the Black Death finally came to an end, but experts have a few compelling theories.</p><p>Some experts posit that the biggest possible reason for the plague’s disappearance was simply modernization.</p><p>People previously thought that the plague was divine punishment for their sins which often led to ineffective remedies that were grounded in mysticism. Alternatively, devout worshippers who did not want to go against “God’s will” stood idly by as the disease swept their homes.</p><p>But with advancements in medical science and a better understanding of bacterial diseases, there emerged new treatments.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-271070 alt="Map Of The Black Plague's Devastation" width=900 height=637 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/map-of-black-plague.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-271070 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Thhis map illustrates the spread of the Black Death.</span></p><p>Indeed, the plague became an impetus for significant developments in medicine and public health regulation. Scientists of the time turned to dissection, the study of blood circulation, and sanitation to find ways to combat the spread of the disease.</p><p>The phrase “quarantine,” in fact, was coined during the outbreak of the Black Plague in Venice in the early 15th century. Historically, however, the policy was only first implemented by the Republic of Ragusa (present-day Dubrovnik in Croatia) in 1377, when the city shuttered its borders for 30 days.</p><p>Others suggest that the plague subsided due to the genetic evolution of human bodies and bacteria itself.</p><p>The reality, though, is that there is still much to be learned about the Black Plague and how it finally subsided.</p><h2>An Unfortunate Resurgence</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-271062 alt="Illustration Of Medieval People In Prayer" width=900 height=604 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prayer.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-271062 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Illustration of people praying for relief from the Black Plague which some people believed was a punishment from God.</span></p><p>The Black Plague was not the first major plague to besiege the world nor will it be the last.</p><p>During the sixth century, a major plague broke out in the Eastern Roman Empire that later became known as the First Plague Pandemic.</p><p>The Black Plague, which followed a few centuries later, was thus known as the Second Plague Pandemic.
