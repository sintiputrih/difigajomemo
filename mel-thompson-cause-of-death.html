And she loved all you right back."</p><p>"I'll continue to love her and miss her forever. She was such a pillar for our family. The kids would talk to her non stop and she was constantly talking with them and trying to help them with their stuff. And no matter how bad she felt, she would still rub my back when I came and jumped on the bed next to her while she was working tirelessly to put out content," he continued.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"Everybody knows how talented she was as an artist and with her helpful knowledge, but those closest to her know how truly wonderful she was.
