His true name remains a closely guarded secret, shrouded in mystery and perpetual speculation.</strong></p><p>Originating from the vibrant underground scene in Bristol, his emergence was marked by collaborative efforts with fellow artists and musicians, notably drawing inspiration from 3D, a graffiti artist and founding member of Massive Attack. His signature style involves a unique blend of dark humor, satirical street art, and subversive epigrams, executed with precision through a distinctive stenciling technique.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Banksy’s Parents?</h2><p>Peter Gordon Gunningham, the retired contracts manager from the Whitehall area of Bristol, and Pamela Ann Dawkin-Jones, who served as a company director’s secretary and was raised in the exclusive surroundings of Clifton, are the proud parents of Banksy. This dynamic duo has played a significant role in shaping the background and upbringing of the individual who would go on to make a mark in the world of art.</p><p>His artistic canvas extends beyond traditional mediums, as he boldly showcases his creations on publicly visible surfaces such as walls and self-constructed physical props. Refusing to commercialize his street graffiti through photographs or reproductions, he has maintained a commitment to the transient nature of his art. Paradoxically, his public “installations” often find their way into the market, with some pieces even being physically removed from their original locations for resale.</p><p>While his works are predominantly temporary, a select few are officially sold through an agency he established, aptly named Pest Control. The artist’s foray into filmmaking culminated in the documentary “Exit Through the Gift Shop,” premiering at the Sundance Film Festival in 2010 and earning him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.</p><p>The mystery surrounding him extends to his personal identity, with conflicting reports adding layers to the intrigue. Descriptions vary, with one account from a 2003 interview portraying him as a scruffy, casual individual with a penchant for anonymity due to the illegal nature of graffiti. There are claims that Banksy began his artistic journey at the age of 14, faced expulsion from school, and even served time in prison for minor offenses.</p><p>In a revelatory interview with the BBC in 2003, he disclosed his forename as Robbie, a snippet of information that only added to the enigma. The Mail on Sunday, in 2008, asserted that Banksy is possibly Robin Gunningham, born in Yate on July 28, 1974, just miles away from Bristol. This claim gains support from associates and former schoolmates who corroborate the connection. A geographic profiling study conducted by researchers at Queen Mary University of London in 2016 further reinforced the notion that <a href=# rel=noopener>Banksy’s</a> works align with Gunningham’s movements.</p><p>The evolution of his identity is a complex narrative, with references to the alias “Robin Banks” and cassette sleeves featuring his artwork from 1993 for the Bristol band Mother Samosa. Even DJ Goldie added a layer of confusion by referring to Banksy as “Rob” in a podcast interview in June 2017. As the mystery deepens, Banksy continues to captivate the world with his thought-provoking art, leaving an indelible mark on the global street art scene.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfqGWRp7JursCnoqyxo2K9or7Ep6usZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-banksys-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-are-banksys-parents.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-banksys-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-are-banksys-parents.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-banksys-parents.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-banksys-parents.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./michelle-rodriguez-loves-and-hookups.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./michelle-rodriguez-loves-and-hookups.html>Who Has Michelle Rodriguez Dated?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./vogue-williams-wiki-age-bio-children-daughter-husband-sister-height-net-worth-instagram.html>Vogue Williams Wiki, Age, Bio, Children, Daughter, Husband, Sister, Height, Net Worth, Instagram</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./vogue-williams-wiki-age-bio-children-daughter-husband-sister-height-net-worth-instagram.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
