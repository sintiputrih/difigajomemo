Many actors would have been satisfied with this, but not Depp. Instead, he set his sights for the big screen, and once he got his chance to shine, he developed into a star that people could not get enough of.</p><p>Whether he was turning heads as Edward Scissorhands, wowing audiences in movies like Blow, or was functioning as more of a heartthrob in Cry-Baby, Depp proved that he could do it all, and do it well.</p><p>The actor has had many iconic roles and projects, but few comes anywhere close to matching what he achieved during his time as a swashbuckling pirate.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Johnny Depp Reacted To Meeting Jim Carrey For The First Time</a></span></p><h2 id=johnny-depp-39-s-time-as-captain-jack-sparrow-made-him-millions>Johnny Depp's Time As Captain Jack Sparrow Made Him Millions</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>2003's Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl was a surprise hit at the box office, and in the blink of an eye, Disney had a massive live-action franchise on its hands. It was truly a once-in-a-lifetime idea that worked, and Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow was the main attraction.</p><p>Depp could not have been a better choice for the role, and he would star in a total of five Pirates movies that contributed to billions of dollars at the box office.</p><p>Thanks to the success of the films and the popularity of Captain Jack Sparrow, Johnny Depp made a fortune.</p><p>"For his first appearance as "Jack Sparrow" in 2003's "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl", Johnny earned $10 million. His base salary for the second "Pirates" installment was $20 million. With backend points her earned an additional $40 million for a total of $60 million. He earned a combined $55 million from the third "Pirates" movie," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A sixth Pirates movies has been in the worlds for some time, but alas, Depp will not be coming back for one last ride.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Johnny Depp's Bodyguard Asked Crude Question About Actor's Manhood In Latest Court Drama</a></span></p><h2 id=depp-was-set-to-make-over-20-million-for-39-pirates-6-39>Depp Was Set To Make Over $20 Million For 'Pirates 6'</h2><p>Fans are no doubt aware of the legal proceedings taking place between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, as it's all news outlets want to speak about. A lot has been revealed, including the amount of money that Depp was supposed to make for a 6th Pirates of the Caribbean movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a>, "The manager, Jack Whigham, said in Depp's defamation trial against his ex-wife that Disney's movie chief Sean Bailey and "Pirates of the Caribbean" producer Jerry Bruckheimer verbally sealed a deal in around 2016 to pay Depp $22.5 million for the sixth movie in the series. But Depp never got to see those million. The sixth "Pirates" movie was never filmed, and Depp never got to reprise his role as Captain Jack Sparrow."</p><p>That is an unthinkable amount of money to lose out on, and it's just one of many ways that the involved parties have been effected during this turbulent time.</p><p>Depp wanted to reprise Captain Jack Sparrow one more time as a send-off, but this opportunity was taken from him.</p><p>"My feeling was that these characters should be able to have their proper goodbye, as it were. A franchise can only last for so long and there's a way to end a franchise like that and I thought that the characters deserved to have their way out, to end the franchise on a very good note. I planned on continuing until it was time to stop," the actor said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>It Took Johnny Depp 22-Hours To Transform For This Role</a></span></p><p>Johnny Depp's case is still moving along, and fans will be tuning in to see what else gets revealed during these proceedings.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's How Johnny Depp Would Constantly Troll David Letterman During Interviews</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKCeo8ZusMSpp2aomaeutbHSZm1mq5GhrrPFjJucn6eimnqjscinnmaemaeypXs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohnny-depp-pirates-6-salary-before-being-fired.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjohnny-depp-pirates-6-salary-before-being-fired.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjohnny-depp-pirates-6-salary-before-being-fired.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjohnny-depp-pirates-6-salary-before-being-fired.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohnny-depp-pirates-6-salary-before-being-fired.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohnny-depp-pirates-6-salary-before-being-fired.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./shawn-mendes-hilariously-calls-out-camila-cabello-in-her-instagram-comments.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./shawn-mendes-hilariously-calls-out-camila-cabello-in-her-instagram-comments.html>Shawn Mendes Hilariously Calls Out Camila Cabello in Her Instagram Comments!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./eddie-long.html>Eddie Long</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./eddie-long.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
