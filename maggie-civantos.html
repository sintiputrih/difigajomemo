She enjoys the American film business, and her favorite actors and actresses are Robert Downey, Jr. and Katherine Hepburn, respectively, and her favorite films are “When Harry Met Sally,” “Groundhog Day,” and “Lost in Translation.”</p><p>Maggie enjoys working out in her own time and goes to the gym several times a week, but her fitness schedule is dictated by the characters she plays in movies and TV shows — she has to stop coming to the gym and eat more if her role is intended to weigh more than she does.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>Maggie has <strong>5ft 4ins (1.62m)</strong> tall with long brown hair and brown eyes, weighs roughly <strong>125lbs (57kgs)</strong>, and has long brown hair and brown eyes.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Giacomo Raspadori</a>, <a href=#>Ivan Rakitic</a>, and <a href=#>Ysabelle Wallace</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Annie Chong</a></h3>Annie Chong estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
