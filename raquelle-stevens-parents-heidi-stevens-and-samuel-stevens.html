Well, this kindness in Raquelle was instilled by her parents, one of whom looked after the Pastoral Care Team in Los Angeles. </span><span>Get to know Raquelle’s parents better as this article proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Who Are Raquelle Stevens Parents?</b></h3><p><span>Raquelle Stevens was born to her parents, Heidi Stevens and Samuel Stevens. They are very close to her. So much so that Raquelle claimed that she can talk to her mother more than any of her friends could talk to theirs.</span></p><p><span>“My family is everything,” she added.</span></p><p><span>All thanks to them, Raquelle now serves as the host of the </span><i><span>Giving Back Generation </span></i><span>video series, which aims to encourage young generations to give back “one good at a time.” She started the project in September 2019 and its second season came out in 2022. So far, the series has included interviews with the likes of Selena, author Jay Shetty, vegan chef Radhi Devlukia-Shetty, TV personality Giulia De Lellis, Team USA heptathlete Chari Hawkins, and many others.</span></p><p><span>With radio host Tanya Rad, Raquelle also teamed up to pen a nonfiction guidebook about finding hope and joy, as well as managing anxious behaviors. So, Raquelle revealed the book </span><i><span>The Sunshine Mind</span></i><span> is releasing in January 2023.</span></p><p><span>But Raquelle only rose to the spotlight in 2022 being featured on </span><i><span>My Mind And Me</span></i><span> — her best friend Selena Gomez’s life story. While inside the documentary, she can be spotted even detailing what Selena’s scariest mental health moment was like when she suffered from an episode of psychosis in 2018.</span></p><p><span>As for Selena, she eventually credits Raquelle and their other two close friends Ashley Cook and Courtney Lopez for helping save her.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Raquelle Stevens Father, Samuel Stevens</b></h3><p><span>Raquelle Stevens was born in the UK to his parents, Mike and Penelope Stevens.</span></p><p><span>The faith in him comes from his dad who continues to serve the Lord “faithfully, without any hint of scandal, with grace, courage, and kindness” as of 2022. Though life hasn’t always been easy, his dad, Mike maintains his integrity and positive attitude day by day. No wonder, he has been following Jesus for almost 70 years since committing at Dean Close School at age 11.</span></p><p><span>Mike @</span><a href=#><span>stevens.mv</span></a><span>, who turned 80 in August 2022, married Penelope in September 1967.

That made him 52 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span>Also, it means he had Raquelle when he was 21.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Samuel Stevens Job</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Samuel Stevens followed in the footsteps of his father and served the Lord.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Is Samuel Stevens On Instagram?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>In 2022, Samuel had 200 followers on his Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>samhstevens</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Raquelle Stevens Mother, Heidi Stevens</b></h3><p><span>Raquelle Stevens’s mother Heidi Stevens is her role model. “Thanks for everything you do for me and for teaching me to live a life full of love & meaning. I love you,” Raquelle dedicated an IG post to Heidi on mothers day 2017.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, Heidi loved her daughter to the moon. On Raquelle’s 30th birthday, Heidi posted their pic on IG captioned, “Happy Birthday to the greatest daughter in the world! I love you and I am so beyond proud of you! Xx.”</span></p><p><span>Also, Heidi was close to her daughter’s best friend Selena Gomez. So close that the star singer attended Heidi’s birthday back in September 2019, and the news even made headlines.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Heidi Stevens Age</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Heidi Stevens was born in September 1968. That made her 53 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, her father, Chuck Pals passed away at the age o 73 in December 2015.</span></p><p><span>Her mother, Violet Pals, and siblings Timothy (Tina) Pals, Todd (Pam) Pals, Jeff (Valarie) Pals, Polly (George) Peterson, John (Sue) Pals, and Amy (Clayton) Mulanax were alive and doing well.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Heidi Stevens Job</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Heidi Stevens is a member of the</span><i><span> Hillsong</span></i><span>, a church in LA. There, she looks after the Pastoral Care team</span></p><p><span>So, why did Heidi choose a job in pastoral care and people? Well, she believes that Jesus is the Prize and people have nothing to earn or attain outside of loving him. “I am passionate about people becoming so secure in their relationship with Jesus Himself that they no longer look to others or situations for their worth or fulfillment,” she explained.</span></p><p><span>Though she only joined the church in 2015, Heidi wishes she had a greater revelation of not needing people’s approval decades ago. “Jesus himself already approves us. When we catch a true revelation of that we can love and serve people unconditionally because we are no longer looking to others for approval,” she added.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Is Heidi Stevens On Instagram?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Find Heidi on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>heidi_sue_stevens</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Are Raquelle Stevens Parents Still Married?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Yes, Raquelle’s parents are still together.
