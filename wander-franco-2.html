His birthday is March 1, 2001. In Major League Baseball (MLB), Franco is a shortstop for the Tampa Bay Rays at the moment. In the year 2021, he made his MLB debut, demonstrating his abilities and potential.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wander-Franco-Married-Social-Media-14-year-old-Posts-Dating-min-1024x580.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Wander_Franco_Bio></span><strong>Wander Franco Bio</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Franco had the distinction of representing the Dominican Republic in the 2023 World Baseball Classic. Franco was asked to play second base owing to the presence of more good shortstops like Willy Adames and Jeremy Pea. Ketel Marte, another talented member of the club, also played with him. Franco played in three games and nine at-bats overall.</p><p>Franco had a batting average of.222, an on-base percentage of.417, and a slugging percentage of.222 while playing the field. Despite having a modest batting average, Franco and Juan Soto managed to secure the most walks for the squad, with three in total.</p><p>Overall, Franco’s World Baseball Classic performance demonstrated his versatility as a player, as he was able to adjust to a new position and helped the team win by being patient and drawing walks. Fans and followers of the sport will continue to watch and respect his potential and talent as a young player.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Wander_Franco_married_or_not></span><strong>Is Wander Franco married or not?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The excellent baseball star Wander Franco wed Nancy Aybar after a protracted courtship. Franco had never been known to be in a relationship before getting married. Since he wants to keep his personal affairs quiet, little is known about his previous partnerships.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Franco is currently happily married and responsible for raising his two children. He values his baseball career and is committed to improving his abilities and succeeding in the sport. Wander Franco Sr., his father, is a native of the Dominican Republic. He is wed to Nancy Aybar, and the two of them have four kids altogether.

It’s crucial to remember that these accusations have not been verified or supported.</p><p>On Sunday, Osleivis Basabe began at shortstop in his major league debut. The 22-year-old athlete had a game-high 1 for 3 performance with a double. On Saturday night, while playing for Triple-A Durham, Basabe was informed of his promotion to the major league.</p><p>The Rays’ Franco, on the other hand, started the game on Sunday in the dugout before leaving in the fifth inning. He received a day off from the squad, it was later discovered. It’s important to note that the Rays offered the Wander Franco Snapback Hat as part of a promotion for game attendees aged 14 and under.</p><p>Rays manager Kevin Cash responded that there was no problem other than it being a usual off day when asked why Franco wasn’t playing. Cash also refuses to address the rumors surrounding Franco’s condition any further.</p><p>Franco’s performance as a teammate and responsiveness to trying circumstances led to the Rays benching him for two games in late June. Even yet, Tampa Bay offered him a lucrative deal worth $182 million over 11 years, with a team option for 2033 that could raise the total value to $223 million.</p><p>Franco has been batting well and has been chosen as an AL All-Star this season.281 in 112 games with 17 home runs, 58 RBIs, and 30 base steals out of 40 attempts.</p><p class=has-medium-font-size><strong>Also, Read</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtor5Gjsaa%2BjJ%2BpmqaTpHpzew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwander-franco-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwander-franco-2.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwander-franco-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwander-franco-2.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwander-franco-2.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwander-franco-2.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-is-topps-rip-night.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-is-topps-rip-night.html>What is Topps Rip Night?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-best-spider-man-quotes-of-all-time.html>The best Spider-Man quotes of all time</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-best-spider-man-quotes-of-all-time.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
