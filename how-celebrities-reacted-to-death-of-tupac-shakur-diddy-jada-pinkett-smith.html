Sharing time in real life as well as on-screen, the Matrix Reloaded star was hit hard by the rapper’s death. On an episode of Red Table Talk, Pinkett said, "I've had a lot of loss. So many of my close friends gone. They didn't make it to 30. They didn't make it past 25. A lot of people talk about my relationship with <strong>Pac </strong>and figure that out. That was a huge loss in my life." Jada continued, "Because he was one of those people I expected to be here. My upset is more anger because I feel like he left me. and I know that's not true, and it's a very selfish way to think about it… I really did believe he'd be here for the long run. And when I think about it, I still get really mad."</p><h2 id=the-notorious-b-i-g><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Notorious B.I.G.</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once a close friend of<strong> Tupac’s</strong>, <strong>Christopher Wallace, aka “The Notorious B.I.G.”</strong> was a controversial figure in Shakur’s life. <a href=#>Pitted against one another in an East Coast vs West Coast hip-hop war</a>, the two monsters of rap were fierce rivals until Tupac’s untimely death.
