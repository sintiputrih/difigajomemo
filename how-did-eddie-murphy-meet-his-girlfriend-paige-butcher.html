Even before that, he had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two sons&nbsp;with two different former girlfriends</a>.</p><p>Fans were a bit surprised to learn he'd had a child with Mel B of Spice Girls fame, back in 2007. They had been dating briefly, but things got more awkward when Murphy denied that he was the father.</p><p>Eventually, it turned out that Melanie Brown had a paternity test to confirm that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eddie was her daughter Angel's dad</a>. But the damage was clearly done, and the pair had already split, so there was no reconciliation happening.</p><p>Eddie later dated a film producer, with whom he exchanged some not-legal vows, before splitting from her the same year.</p><p>But in 2012, Eddie Murphy met Paige Butcher and the pair began dating.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How Much Eddie Murphy Pays In Child Support</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paige is a model, of course, and also an actress. The child she and Eddie welcomed in 2016 was her first (and they later had a second, his tenth). But how did they wind up together in the first place? Well, the key is that she&nbsp;is an actress, even if it's not her full-time gig.</p><p>In fact,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heavy</a> explained, Eddie and Paige first met on the set of the film 'Big Momma's House 2.' The story goes that Eddie was on set visiting his friend Martin Lawrence, and he interacted with Paige.</p><p>The movie came out in 2006, the same year Eddie's drama was going on with Mel B, and probably around the time his marriage to Nicole Mitchell was falling apart.</p><p>Though he and Paige didn't connect immediately or start dating at the time,&nbsp;Heavy&nbsp;suggests that they became friendly after meeting on the movie set, and perhaps kept in touch afterward.</p><p>Although, Paige&nbsp;did see other people before reconnecting with Murphy in 2012. Her history includes dating a model and also Russell Simmons. So the model and actress had some idea of what it would be like to date a high-profile celebrity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact,&nbsp;Heavy quotes the star and mom of two as saying that though she previously had social media, she decided to get rid of all of them when she and Eddie got together. It was much easier to avoid gossip and drama without social media, and Paige's goal is to "keep as much private as possible now."</p><p>Though fans can't expect any tell-alls from Paige or Eddie, it does sound like they're truly happy together with their ever-growing family (their second child arrived in 2018).
