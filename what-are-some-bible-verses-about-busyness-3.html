Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.</p><p>Haggai 1:5-9</p><p>Now, therefore, thus says the Lord of hosts: Consider your ways. You have sown much, and harvested little. You eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm. And he who earns wages does so to put them into a bag with holes. Thus says the Lord of hosts: “Consider your ways. Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that I may take pleasure in it and that I may be glorified, says the Lord. You looked for much, and behold, it came to little. And when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? declares the Lord of hosts. Because of my house that lies in ruins, while each of you busies himself with his own house.”</p><p>Matthew 6:33</p><p>But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</p><p>1 Corinthians 10:31</p><p>So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.</p><p>Proverbs 3:5</p><p>Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.</p><p>Matthew 11:28-30</p><p>Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</p><p>Psalm 127:2</p><p>It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest, eating the bread of anxious toil; for he gives to his beloved sleep.</p><p>Isaiah 55:1-2</p><p>Come, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and he who has no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that which does not satisfy? Listen diligently to me, and eat what is good, and delight yourselves in rich food.</p><p>Psalm 46:10</p><p>“Be still, and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth!”</p><p>Romans 12:2</p><p>Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.</p><p>Matthew 11:28</p><p>Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</p><p>Psalm 39:6</p><p>Surely a man goes about as a shadow! Surely for nothing they are in turmoil; man heaps up wealth and does not know who will gather!</p><p>Colossians 3:23</p><p>Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men,</p><p>Deuteronomy 8:18</p><p>You shall remember the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your fathers, as it is this day.</p><p>James 1:21-25</p><p>Therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.</p><p>Philippians 4:6</p><p>Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.</p><p>Psalm 119:105</p><p>Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.</p><p>Hebrews 4:12</p><p>For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</p><p>Luke 16:10</p><p>One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.</p><p>Matthew 6:25</p><p>Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?</p><p>Unless otherwise noted, all Bible verses are from The Holy Bible, English Standard Version® Copyright© 2001 by Crossway Bibles, a publishing ministry of Good News Publishers.</p><p>Special thanks to <a href=# rel=noopener>OpenBible.info</a> for the data on the most well-known Bible verses.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSesrSu1LOxZ5ufonuotI6wn5qsXZa%2FpnnSqKSeZZKer62xjK%2Bcq6uVqHqirs6uq2aapajGr7HSrGRsZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-are-some-bible-verses-about-busyness-3.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-are-some-bible-verses-about-busyness-3.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-are-some-bible-verses-about-busyness-3.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-are-some-bible-verses-about-busyness-3.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-are-some-bible-verses-about-busyness-3.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-are-some-bible-verses-about-busyness-3.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./afsaneh-dehrouyeh.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./afsaneh-dehrouyeh.html>Afsaneh Dehrouyeh</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./top-five-comic-books-martin-scorsese-should-absolutely-turn-into-a-movie.html>Top five comic books Martin Scorsese should absolutely turn into a movie</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./top-five-comic-books-martin-scorsese-should-absolutely-turn-into-a-movie.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
