He was home alone and trying to call my parents and no one was answering."</p><p>"I do not come from money, at all, and typically I would be the person to step up to the plate to help," Todrick said. "But, as a performer who's just recovering from the pandemic and the union strike myself, there's only so much I can do. I have helped where I can, but I can't get the entire family back on their feet at this moment as I'm in a transitional period myself."</p><p>Finally, Todrick said he "wasn't going to start a GoFundMe," but his fans convinced him this was better than selling merch.</p><p>He then went on to detail the devastation to the house.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by TODRICK (@todrick)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Some fans feel bad for Todrick Hall and his family while others are outraged.</h2><p>As Todrick revealed about the tragedy, "At first we thought that it was just part of the home, the living room and kitchen, and that maybe it could be fixed, but upon inspection and going into the home it turns out the entire home is unlivable."</p><p>Todrick also told fans via the GoFundMe that his family was renting the home. At the end of the lengthy share, he profusely thanked fans for their support during this difficult time.</p><p>And while many commenters expressed their concern and well wishes for the family — and it must be said, the goal of $10,000 had been surpassed at the time of writing — there has also been some backlash.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Todrick Hall posted a GoFundMe asking strangers for 10K for his family house that burned down but then hosted his birthday party last night where he had horses and a petting zoo… like…</p>— Matthew Stevens (@mvstevens) <a href=#>April 5, 2024</a></figure><p>Some fans are upset that Todrick is asking fans for financial help when his net worth is so comfortable. As one person blasted him on his Instagram, "G wagon in the driveway. Mega mansion in L.A. Closet full of designer couture. You could sell half of those designer shoes and make $10,000 to help your family."</p><p>The person went on to say, "This is the definition of selfish. I’m sorry this happened to your family but how dare you flaunt your wealth and then ask your followers who don’t have nearly the wealth you do to help your family. I was a fan of yours but now I see you’d rather not use your own money to help the people you love — you’d put that weight on others first."</p><p>Still someone else said, "The last video I saw of Todrick's was him bragging about having this lavish new mansion in L.A. I am sorry but recovering from the pandemic after posting that video? We all know that this is in poor taste. I am sorry."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by TODRICK (@todrick)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Todrick Hall's net worth isn't doing him any favors right now.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Todrick is worth an astonishing $12 million.</p><p>He did recently share a tour of his lavish Los Angeles mansion via Instagram, which he listed for sale for $8.5 million in December 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbylvsicomagkaG5brPOn6ynnJ2aeqW%2BwKaY</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftodrick-hall-gofundme-drama.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftodrick-hall-gofundme-drama.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftodrick-hall-gofundme-drama.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftodrick-hall-gofundme-drama.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftodrick-hall-gofundme-drama.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftodrick-hall-gofundme-drama.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./new-music-friday-willie-jones-mitchell-tenpenny-sam-williams-lainey-wilson-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./new-music-friday-willie-jones-mitchell-tenpenny-sam-williams-lainey-wilson-more.html>Willie Jones, Mitchell Tenpenny, Sam Williams, Lainey Wilson &amp;amp; More Celeb Secrets Country</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./garchomp-unite.html>Garchomp (UNITE) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./garchomp-unite.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
