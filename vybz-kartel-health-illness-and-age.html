He was accused of murder in 2014 along with numerous members of his group.</p><p>Vybz Kartel has continued to be relevant in the music industry while being imprisoned.</p><h2><span id=Does_Vybz_Kartel8217s_Skin_Bleed>Does Vybz Kartel’s Skin Bleed?</span></h2><p>Vybz Kartel has a reputation for using unpopular skin-bleaching techniques. He acknowledged using “cake soap” to lighten his skin, saying it was a personal decision and a method to stand out in the music business.</p><p>However, a lot of his detractors have charged him with spreading racism and self-hatred.</p><p>Vybz defended his choice, saying that he was not embarrassed by his race and that it was a form of creative expression.</p><p>Additionally, Kartel said that successful light-skinned musicians like Sean Paul and Bob Marley had an advantage over him in the global music industry.</p><p>Insider sources claim that Vybz Kartel eventually quit whitening his skin as a result of his altered perspective.</p><p>Discussions over Kartel’s health, identity, and impact on his followers have been generated by the controversy surrounding his skin bleaching.</p><p>Others regard it as a sign of low self-esteem or a denial of his background, while some see it as a personal decision or a way of expressing oneself.</p><p>Whatever the situation, Vybz Kartel’s skin bleaching is a reflection of the nuanced and frequently divisive problems with race, colorism, and beauty in Jamaica and elsewhere.</p><h2><span id=Vybz_Kartel8217s_Health_Condition>Vybz Kartel’s Health Condition</span></h2><p>Kartel is presently serving a life sentence for murder, but due to a fatal ailment called Graves’ disease, his health is worsening.</p><p>Vybz Kartel’s lawyer claims that the musician needs surgery for two heart issues that are causing swelling in his face and neck and making it difficult for him to breathe.</p><p>He is reportedly held in inhumane and hazardous circumstances, such as being confined for 23 hours each day in a heated cell without the necessary amenities.</p><p>His attorney is fighting for Kartel’s release and plans to appeal his 2014 conviction before the Privy Council in London because the evidence and the trial were flawed and inconsistent.</p><p>Concerns regarding Vybz Kartel’s health and well-being are shared by his family and supporters.</p><h2><span id=What_Is_the_Age_of_Vybz_Kartel>What Is the Age of Vybz Kartel?</span></h2><p>On January 7, 1976, Vybz Kartel was born in Kingston, Jamaica. As of 2023, he is 47 years old.</p><p>In 1993, Vybz Kartel began his adolescent career.

He was found guilty in 2014 of killing his friend Clive “Lizard” Williams and given a life sentence with a 35-year parole potential.</p><p>Vybz has repeatedly contested his conviction and maintained his innocence without success. Despite this, Vybz Kartel has been one of the most important personalities in the development of Jamaican music.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Viggo Sorensen, Avivasofia, and Giselle Guilmette."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":37}{"1":43,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":60}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/viggo-sorensen/"}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":"https://popularbio.com/avivasofia/"}{"1":37}{"1":43,"2":"https://popularbio.com/giselle-guilmette/"}{"1":60}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Viggo Sorensen</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Avivasofia</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Giselle Guilmette</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Artist</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Producer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Update On Elena Huelva’s Cancer | Is She Hospitalized</a></h3>a well-known person who uses TikTok to record her cancer treatment there.
