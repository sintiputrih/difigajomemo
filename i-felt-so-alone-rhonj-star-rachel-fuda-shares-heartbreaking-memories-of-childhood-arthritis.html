In honor of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Juvenile Arthritis Awareness Month</a>, she shared some insight on what that was like.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=224 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>She called the disease a “lifelong physical and emotional battle,” per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>. Arthritis, by the way, is (very simply) a swelling and tenderness around joints, but there are many, many variations of the disease.</p><p>“It’s the type of chronic illness that affects children and adults so greatly, but many of us with arthritis suffer with [it] in silence. I’m here to use my voice to change that; to let people know just how difficult life with arthritis can be on a daily basis and to let others suffering with it know that they are not alone.”</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=191 data-injectable=false>Her arthritic symptoms started when she was just four years old. After a tumble off some monkey bars, she was taken to the hospital with what doctors thought was a garden-variety broken leg.</p><p data-characters=140 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>When doctors took the cast off a few months later, instead of a healed leg they discovered it had ballooned to four times its original size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 data-characters=264 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>“I was having an arthritis flare-up and it wasn’t diagnosed yet. They put me on just a small dose of Naproxen, [an anti-inflammatory drug designed to reduce inflammation and swelling], and then it just went away. And I went into remission for years.”</p><p data-characters=137 data-current-count=137 data-injectable=false>The disease resurfaced with a vengeance when she was in the fifth grade. Her official diagnosis? Systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>“I was out playing with my friends and I just felt so tired. And I had this crazy-high fever that lasted two weeks. My mom was traveling for business and I kept telling my dad, ‘Dad, my body hurts so bad. I can’t walk up the stairs. I’m sweating constantly. Something is wrong.'”</p><p data-characters=61 data-current-count=61 data-injectable=false>This time around was much, much worse than her previous bout.</p><p>“Once again, I was having an arthritis flare-up, only this time, it was horrible. I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t get myself dressed, I couldn’t brush my hair, I couldn’t shower myself. It was so incredibly life-altering for me.”</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true>Doctors gave her Prednisone, a steroid used to cover a large swath of inflammatory diseases. She was taking up to 150 mgs of the drug a day to alleviate her symptoms. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">average dose</a> is between 5 and 60 mgs a day.</p><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=186 data-injectable=false>Between the medicine and weight gain from the steroids, she was miserable. Other drugs didn’t seem to work, either. It made things very difficult for her during her teenage years.</p><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>“Being an adolescent pre-teen is such a hard time in a kid’s life to begin with. Your body is already going through so many changes and then to add this on top of it? It was torture.”</p><p data-characters=118 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>Because she was so young, she felt like she didn’t know how to deal with things and “felt so alone.”</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>“So many children with chronic illness feel the same way because as much as it is a physical battle, it’s emotionally and mentally equally as difficult to want to be like everyone else, but be so different at the same time.”</p><p data-characters=119 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>Eventually, she found a drug that helped. She also joined the Arthritis Foundation, which had a support group for kids.</p><p>“It gave me a safe place to talk about my feelings and to connect with kids my age who felt the same way. I felt empathy for the first time from someone my age. It made such a positive impact in my life and I’m still in touch with a lot of people I met during that time.”</p><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=125 data-injectable=false>Her life now is of course very different. She decided to get off all drugs to have children, but then the symptoms came back.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by RACHEL 🤍 (@rachelfuda)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=109 data-injectable=false>She stressed the importance of having a place to go and people to talk to when you have a life long disease.</p><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=true>“The flare-ups can happen at any time, so I’m always going to need to have a plan in place.
