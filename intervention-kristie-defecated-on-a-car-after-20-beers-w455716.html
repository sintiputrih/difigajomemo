<time>20 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The brutal and gritty reality of addiction was in full-force on the Tuesday, December 13, episode of A&E’s <i><a href=#>Intervention</a></i>. This episode centered around Kristie — a 31-year-old former John Hopkins grad student — and her family as they struggled to get her the help she needed.</p><p><b>Kristie Drank 20 Beers a Day and Huffed One to Five Cans of Duster</b></p><p>The episode began with a background on Kristie’s 13-year-long addiction to alcohol. With a history of mental-health arrests, hospital trips and a body teetering on organ failure, her friends and family were fearing for her life. Her mother, Mary, told the camera, “She starts drinking as soon as she gets up in the morning.” In addition to drinking “about 20 beers a day,” according to her mom, she also huffs one to five cans of duster a day.</p><p><b>Kristie Defecated Onto a Car</b></p><p>We were then introduced to Kristie’s best friend, Hillary, who explained that at one point when Kristie was drunk, she “defecated on a car.” They then cut to footage of said event which occurred in broad daylight, ending with a half-naked Kristie falling onto the grass.</p><p><b>Kristie Developed OCD After Her Parents Fought</b></p><p>As far as the background for the Macedon, New York, native, it appeared as though she had a mostly successful childhood, up until her parents started to fight constantly. Mary admitted, “There was arguing every day. There was a constant tenseness in the house.” It was then that Kristie began to exhibit symptoms of OCD, a driving force into her addiction. Hillary explained, “That’s how she decided to cope with her OCD.”</p><p><b>Kristie Was Too Drunk to Dance at Her Own Wedding</b></p><p>Two years after graduating from college, Kristie got married. It was clear to her family that Kristie’s drinking was out of control on her wedding day. Her older sister Kate told the camera, “The DJ couldn’t get Kristie onto the ballroom floor for her own wedding dance.” Two years later, the marriage dissolved, and in 2015 Kristie went to rehab, only to find herself getting heavily into dusters and eventually drinking again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bweewr-fc3edbd2-8fae-4d24-aa5c-1d3a113c8f5a.jpg><p>The episode picked up with Kristie drinking in the morning, refusing to go to the hospital because of her bloody stool. Her anxious father, Dan, confessed, “She’s gonna die. So if this doesn’t work, I don’t know what we’ll do.” Mary called Kristie’s best friend “toxic” and explained, “When Kristie goes over to Hillary’s house, she seems to come home more intoxicated.”</p><p><b>Kristie’s Best Friend Bought Her Vodka During a Court Hearing</b></p><p>We then watched as Hillary drove her best friend to a court appearance, even encouraging her and giving her money to buy a bottle of vodka to get her through the proceedings. Kristie herself admitted, “Hillary spoils me rotten. She takes me out to eat. She buys me clothes.… She’s also a definite enabler.” A desperate Hillary admitted, “I feel terrible — like I’m doing this to her because I don’t want her to be sick. And I’m killing her at the same time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/huff-451c22d4-aa16-41e1-82fd-232994154a2f.jpg><p><b>Hillary Walks Out on Kristie’s Family</b></p><p>At the pre-intervention family meeting, tensions flew between Hillary and Kristie’s older sister Kate. When the intervention specialist, Ken Seeley, brought up the idea of Kristie coming home after treatment, Kate snapped, saying, “Not everyone here is going to be part of her life at that point.” This caused Hillary to take off her mic and leave the room, only to be convinced by Seeley to come back in for the sake of Kristie’s life.</p><p><b>Hillary Was “Mortified” When Kristie Defecated on a Car</b></p><p>When Kristie finally joined her family and Hillary at the intervention, tears started flowing. Hillary was the first to speak, saying, “When you used the bathroom on that car, I was mortified.… People were taking pictures. They were laughing.” She continued, “I may not have been the best friend in allowing some of the things you’ve done to happen, but that stops today.”</p><p><b>Kristie Agreed to Get Treatment</b></p><p>Her mom then vowed to cut Kristie off financially if she doesn’t accept the treatment. Her sister Kate clarified, “If you get out of rehab, and you don’t stay clean, we have all decided that we need to shut mom out of our lives.” Kristie finally agreed to treatment and said goodbye to her family, heading to Florida to begin her <a href=# data-link=1>detox</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><i><a href=#>Intervention</a></i> airs on A&E Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKCnrJWnw6a606Kmp2Wbp7a0wMieZJ2dlpqwosDEnWSopl2WeqSt0WaYn6yVp3pzfIybnJ6qo2LEdYGUcGhvZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fintervention-kristie-defecated-on-a-car-after-20-beers-w455716.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fintervention-kristie-defecated-on-a-car-after-20-beers-w455716.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fintervention-kristie-defecated-on-a-car-after-20-beers-w455716.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fintervention-kristie-defecated-on-a-car-after-20-beers-w455716.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fintervention-kristie-defecated-on-a-car-after-20-beers-w455716.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fintervention-kristie-defecated-on-a-car-after-20-beers-w455716.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ayesha-curry-net-worth-2024-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ayesha-curry-net-worth-2024-2.html>Ayesha Curry Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./watch-bill-murrays-surprise-new-york-city-concert-html.html>Watch Bill Murray Give a Surprise Concert in Washington Square Park</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./watch-bill-murrays-surprise-new-york-city-concert-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
