The show has run for three seasons so far and is due to be renewed for a fourth season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the actors who star in the series include Emma Mackey, Asa Butterfield, Aimee Lou Wood, Kedar Williams-Sterling, rising star Mimi Keene, and Tanya Reynolds.</p><p>Since it first aired in 2019, the show has been labeled 'one of the best shows on Netflix' and has achieved extremely high ratings. On Google reviews, it has been rated a whopping 4.8 out of 5 stars, while it scores 8.4/10 on IMBd, 95% on Rotten Tomatoes, and 5/5 from the Evening Standard. Now that's definitely something to shout about.</p><p>However, despite its raging success, not all the characters are destined to stay on the show. Naturally, some cast members have already parted ways with the show, including Simone Ashley and Patricia Allison.</p><h2 id=what-shows-has-tanya-reynolds-been-in>What Shows Has Tanya Reynolds Been In?</h2><p>Tanya Reynolds is most commonly known for her role as Lily in Sex Education, however, this isn't the only series that the actress has starred in during her career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="'Sex Education': What Were The Actors Doing Before The Hit Show Aired?">'Sex Education': What Were The Actors Doing Before The Hit Show Aired?</a></span></p><p>She launched her acting career by starring in the short film Civilised People in 2015, later moving on to star in The Jealous Boyfriend and Introducing Lucy in the same year. However, it would only be later in 2016 that she would land her first-ever tv appearance in Delicious, where she played the role of Teresa Benelli.</p><p>Since then she has gone on to star in Outlander, Rellik, Fanny Lye Deliver'd, and more recently in 2020, she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">landed a role in Emma</a>, a 2020 remake of Jane Austen's film.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Who Is Mimi Keene?

Lily is a young student who has a passion for aliens and writing about alien-erotica, which she expressed to those whom she became close with.</p><p>Throughout all three seasons, we see Reynolds's character go through a courageous journey of self-discovery. At first, we can see that Lily is unsure about her sexuality, and is clearly pressured by the need to 'fit in' with societal and high-school 'norms'. However, it is hard for her to keep this up for long.</p><p>In Season 2, Lily discovers that she is bisexual after sharing a kiss with Ola, who has always been very supportive of her. After forming such a close bond with Ola, she slowly opens up to her about her passion for aliens and galaxies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many of the characters on Sex Education have their own unique personas, which many fans have come to love them for. However, it's not just the fans that love the characters. While on set, much of the cast has seemingly become quite close also, <a href=#>sharing pictures for their fans on social media</a> of their day-to-day activities.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="How Emma Mackey Really Felt About Filming Intimate Scenes In 'Sex Education' ">How Emma Mackey Really Felt About Filming Intimate Scenes In 'Sex Education'</a></span></p><p>Reynolds shared a snap on Instagram, revealing some behind-the-scenes from the third season of the show. In the snap she unveiled pictures of her two castmates alongside a handwritten note, which certainly helped to build fans excitement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-tanya-reynolds-left-sex-education>Why Tanya Reynolds Left Sex Education</h2><p>After spending three successful seasons on the show, Tanya Reynolds is officially leaving Sex Education. However, many fans have been left wondering why, particularly after the departure of two other castmates after the third season, Simone Ashley and Patricia Allison, who played Olivia and Ola.</p><p>In an interview with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio Times</a>, which first reported the news, the 30-year-old English Actress opened up and explained her exit from the show; “It's just the natural progression of these shows — when you have such big ensemble casts and so many characters, I think you have to let a few older characters go to make way for newer ones, which is absolutely the right thing, the way it should happen.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, she didn't go into too much detail. Despite her departure, Reynolds made the love for her character, Lily, very clear, stating that she 'loved every minute of it and loved Lily with her entire heart', adding that 'three seasons was the perfect amount' for her.</p><p>After starring in Sex Education, Reynolds is set to star in the HBO series <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Baby</a>, alongside other projects, so fans can catch her there. There is no doubt that her role as Lily has ultimately helped to give her acting career a step up, and will perhaps even open more doors for the actress in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqa6vxcBmqZ6xnqS5pb%2BMpZyfrF2osrl5xJ2snJmknryvew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-tanya-reynolds-left-sex-education.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-tanya-reynolds-left-sex-education.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-tanya-reynolds-left-sex-education.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-tanya-reynolds-left-sex-education.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-tanya-reynolds-left-sex-education.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-tanya-reynolds-left-sex-education.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./was-frank-sinatra-a-baseball-fan.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./was-frank-sinatra-a-baseball-fan.html>Was Frank Sinatra a Baseball Fan?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./generation-vii-learnset.html>Rotom (Pokmon)/Generation VII learnset - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./generation-vii-learnset.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
