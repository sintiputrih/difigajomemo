That makes sense as not everyone is going to get along. Reality TV fans know that Kelly and her family rose to fame after starring in&nbsp;The Osbournes, the show that is often credited with being an early part of the genre. It aired on MTV from March 2002 until March 2005.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ozzy's other daughter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aimee didn't want a public life</a>, but since Kelly did appear on&nbsp;The Osbournes, how did she feel about it? Let's take a look at whether or not she enjoyed being on a reality show.</p><h2 id=mental-health-struggles>Mental Health Struggles</h2><p>While starring on a reality series seems great, as&nbsp;some cast members are paid high salaries and given the exposure to work on any projects that they want, it's not a walk in the park for many others. It makes sense that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aimee Osbourne wanted to be more private</a>.</p><p>Kelly Osbourne shared that she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">struggled with mental health issues</a> after starring on&nbsp;The Osbournes.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Metro.co.uk, she said that she started abusing substances and she knew that she had to get better. She said, "It was time for me to go and figure out how to be me without any sort of substance or support from a chemical. I needed to fix what was broken. I took more than a year, almost two years."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She told the publication that being on the show was really difficult because she assumed that being so young, she wouldn't really be on it very much. That didn't end up being the case.</p><p>She said, "Even when I signed up to do The Osbournes when I was 15, I didn’t think it would really focus on me. Me and my brother were just people in the background. I didn’t realize that the show would completely change my life. It is something that I don’t think I will ever fully understand because being in the moment when it is happening to you, it’s so insane when you are still trying to figure out who you are. I was a kid!"</p><p>According to&nbsp;Self.com,&nbsp;Osbourne relapsed a few years ago. After she had a tough time, she was celebrating a year of&nbsp;being sober&nbsp;in 2018. She said, “To cut a long story short, things got really dark. I gave up on everything in my life but most of all I gave up on myself. Life on life’s terms became too much for me to handle. The only way I knew how to function was to self medicate and go from project to project so I never had to focus on what was really going on with me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, things were definitely looking up for Osbourne, as she shared with a talk show in Britain called&nbsp;Lorraine&nbsp;that she had been sober for two years, and "it's completely changed my life."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ozzy Osbourne Cancels His Tour, And Sharon Osbourne Debuts A Bold New Look</a></span></p><h2 id=her-memoir>Her Memoir</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly Osbourne wrote a memoir</a> and, according to&nbsp;Wtop.com, she was very&nbsp;open about her self-esteem issues earlier in life.</p><p>As the star explained, "I hated who I was and spent so much time learning to at least be content with myself. I got frustrated that people thought I was someone I’m not, but then I realized how ridiculously selfish that is of me if I’m not going to tell them who I am. … I’m so nervous about this [book], because it is so honest. This is my life and most people are going to think that I’m bloody nuts, but that’s OK.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sharon Osbourne Had Major Beef With Jonah Hill’s Brother</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-reboot>A Reboot?</h2><p>Even though Kelly Osbourne has shared that starring on a reality show wasn't good for her mental health, there has been talk of a reboot of&nbsp;The Osbournes.</p><p>According to&nbsp;The Sun, Jack Osbourne said the family was "in talks" and he said it was because of "nostalgia."&nbsp;In an interview from 2019, Kelly Osbourne shared that the family was approached quite a lot about doing a new show.&nbsp;According to&nbsp;iheart.com, she said, "I'm not joking, every single year about every three months or so someone else gives us another offer and we keep saying no."</p><p>The latest on the reboot is from March 2020, when Kelly told&nbsp;ET Online&nbsp;"this is the closest we've ever come" about bringing the show back. She said that because of Covid-19, the show&nbsp;isn't going to happen right now.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gray Hair, Don’t Care… Sharon Osbourne’s Focus Is Warding Off Obesity</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether a reboot of&nbsp;The Osbournes&nbsp;is going to happen remains to be seen, but in the meantime, it's moving and inspiring to learn that Kelly Osbourne has gone through some difficult times but come out on the other side.</p><p><span class=related-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heavy Metal Godfather Ozzy Osbourne Dislikes The Term Heavy Metal</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoLKtuNhmpqyan6q%2Fr7GMnqWjp6lir6a1zaBkqKZdlnqzscCloK2xXai1sMOO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-kelly-osbourne-enjoy-being-on-a-reality-show.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-kelly-osbourne-enjoy-being-on-a-reality-show.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-kelly-osbourne-enjoy-being-on-a-reality-show.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-kelly-osbourne-enjoy-being-on-a-reality-show.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-kelly-osbourne-enjoy-being-on-a-reality-show.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-kelly-osbourne-enjoy-being-on-a-reality-show.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./huawei-launches-mate-20-x-5g-in-the-uk-available-in-june.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./huawei-launches-mate-20-x-5g-in-the-uk-available-in-june.html>Huawei Launches Mate 20 X 5G in the UK: Available in June</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dale-bidinger-obituary.html>Dale Bidinger Obituary: In loving memory of Dale Bidinger of St. Cloud, MN</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dale-bidinger-obituary.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
