Shannon stated that they participated in the show because “[they] just wanted people to know who [they] are” on a national level.</p><p>The twinsy were removed from the series following the seventh episode, in which an altercation occurred involving other cast members destroying their belongings. They stated that “[they] would never do [Bad Girls Club] again,” but stated that “[they] definitely grew from that show [and] learned a lot” and credited the show with “[allowing them] to get an audience that really grew with [them].”</p><p>They have acknowledged the show for having significantly expanded their fanbase on social media, and have been labeled as influencers following their appearance. Highsnobiety writer Lia McGarrigle commented that the Clermont twins’ appearances on Bad Girls Club “harnessed their […] notoriety as a launchpad to build their personal brand”, and was comparable to Cardi B’s appearance on Love & Hip Hop: New York before the release of her signature song “Bodak Yellow”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=fashion-and-modeling></span><span>Fashion and modeling</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Clermont twins’ public profile was significantly increased after being featured in Kanye West’s “Yeezy Season 6” collection in January 2018, in which they appeared alongside models including Paris Hilton as “clones” of Kim Kardashian. They were unaware of Kardashian’s and West’s interest in their participation until the day before the campaign was shot in December 2017.</p><p>The twins later modeled for Gypsy Sport during New York Fashion Week in 2018; they walked together for The Blonds in January 2019 and Shannon independently for Chromat in September 2019. Previously, the twins modeled for fall 2015 Married to the Mob collection.</p><p>They launched their Mont Boudoir fashion label in 2017, which they designed to be “timeless” and has been reviewed as “equal parts Western cowboy and gothy ’90s starlet.” The brand relaunched with the “Money” sunglasses in June 2020. They acknowledged Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen as being among their inspirations for the collection. Previously, the twins interned for fashion labels including Jovani and Yves Saint Laurent.</p><p>The twins have appeared in music videos including “Same Damn Time” and “Real Sisters” by Future, and “Good Form” by Nicki Minaj.</p><h1><span><span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Shannade Clermont</span></span></span></h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-shannade></span><span><span><span>Who is Shannade?</span></span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jenee Clermont is an American model, fashion designer, and TV personality.
