Vespiquen Box was a Pokémon Trading Card Game deck archetype mainly played in the 2015-2016 season, remaining as a contender up to the 2018-2019 season. The deck's strategy revolved around Vespiquen's Bee Revenge Attack, which scales damage for each Pokémon in the player's discard pile.

今年はバンドとしての活動もバッチリ行なっており、
全国ツアーが終わっても、新曲をリリース、
さらには夏にはフェスへの出演三昧と、
音楽としても、タレントとしても大忙しです。
そんな野田洋次郎さんはファンが当然が多く、
RADの中でも武田さんや桑原さんのイケメンコンビに負けじと、
女性ファンを多く抱えています。
その独特な価値観や見解は、
女性だけでなく男性をも虜にし、
洗練された人間性に魅力を感じる方は多くいることでしょう。
そして俳優としての活動が活発になってからも、
芸能界の美女たちとの噂も絶えません。
今、ロキノン系のロックスターの中で、
もっともモテるのは野田さんではないでしょうか？
野田洋次郎はブサイクではない！(モテ過ぎる理由) 野田洋次郎さんの魅力といえば、
個性的なファッションや髪型、
背が高くスタイルが良い面で、
その独特の着こなしが良いハマり方をしてるのです。
ファッション的な要素だけでなく、
RADのフロントマンとしての立ち振る舞いもカッコよく、
ギターボーカルとしての存在感や、
ダダなどでのアグレッシヴな煽り方など、
一度ステージでの野田さんを見てしまうと惚れてしまいます。
ツイッターなどでは素直で素朴な書き込みが多く、
人のフィーリングをくすぐる見解が多く、
「わかるわかる」と引き込まれる文章力を誇ります。
また、私生活では男を見る目が肥えている、
美人女優さんたちにモテモテなので、
素行の面でも、人を惹きつける何かがあることでしょう。
また、燃え尽き状態の要因のひとつとして挙げられているのが、交際していたRADWIMPSのボーカル・野田洋次郎との破局だ。吉高と野田は2013年2月に「週刊女性」（主婦と生活社）が交際を報道、一時は破局も噂されたが、昨年の5月には「女性セブン」（小学館）がふたりのデート現場＆半同棲情報をキャッチ。しかし今年2月には「FLASH」（光文社）が破局したと伝えている。しかも、野田のほうから吉高を振ったらしく、吉高の親友であるハリセンボンの近藤春菜らは吉高を慰める女子会を開いたといわれている。引用元：http://www.excite.co.jp/News/entertainment_g/20150521/Litera_1120.html
少し前に噂になった吉高さんですが、
野田さん側から振ったとされています。
やはり天然が行き過ぎた部分が強い彼女だけに、
常識ある野田さんとの価値観にズレが出ていたのでしょうか？
ぶっ飛んだ発想を併せ持ってる野田さんからすれば、
時より爆発的にフィーリングが合う点があったと思いますが、
人間としての基本ができてない部分が、難題だったと思います。
そして、今年２０１７年の元旦では、
元AKBの前田さんとの噂も話題になりました。
しかし、この報道は１００%ガセのようで、
前田さんも野田さんもその日のうちに否定してます。
そんななか『デイリースポーツ』は、前田敦子（25才）とロックバンド『RADWIMPS』の野田洋次郎（31才）の親密交際を報じた。
ところが、すぐに前田がツイッターで《全く、ないですよ!!そんな根も葉もない噂で出ちゃうと相手方にも、ファンのみなさんに申し訳ないです》と完全否定。対する野田も《熱愛報道みたいなのが出てるみたいですがまったくの事実無根です。正月早々。相手方にも申し訳ないので、伝えさせてもらいます》と、こちらもツイッターで断固否定した。引用元：http://www.news-postseven.com/archives/20170302_497891.html
そして、その後には長澤まさみさんとの会食も報道されてます。
2月21日の夜8時過ぎ、野田は迷っていた。新曲のメロディーや歌詞に悩んでいたわけではない。文字通り、道に迷っていた。スマホを何度も確認し、やっとの思いでたどり着いたのは都内の目抜き通りから1本入った路地裏にある知る人ぞ知るベトナム料理店。
「遅れてごめん！」
平謝りの彼を店内で待っていたのは長澤まさみ（29才）だった。
「テーブル席に座っていた長澤さんは特に怒っているという感じもなくて、野田さんも安心したのか“よっ！”みたいな感じ。もうひとり、年上の女性も同席していました」（居合わせた客）引用元：http://www.news-postseven.com/archives/20170302_497891.html
実際に交際してるかは謎ですが、
友人として信頼されていることは確かでしょう。
もともと長澤さんはRADの音楽が好きということで、
野田さんに惚れていた可能性が高いです。
音楽を通じて好きになる女性が多いですが、
普通にしてても、それなりにモテるタイプだと思います。
ラジオでは共演してる女性にも好意を抱かれたり、
優しくて丁寧な人柄に、惚れ込む方が多いと思います。
ライブでのMCでの野田さんも素敵なので、
私生活での彼をイメージするのは、
悪い部分はどこにもありません。
モテるという言葉を使うと安っぽいですが、
とにかく人間力の高い方であり、
誇り高くて思いやりもある、最高の男なのです。
野田洋次郎と藤原基央の声が似てる点(自覚？)。対談と尊敬(画像) 昔からちょいちょい言われている、
RADの野田さんとバンプの藤原さんが似てる話。
