We had to climb up a ladder to get to that.”</p><p>As a result of the tricky set, “hair and makeup couldn’t reach out,” which meant Winslet, 48, had to act as the on-set makeup artist for both her and DiCaprio, 49.</p><p>“I’ve got hidden [in my corset] his makeup and brushes and sponge, and my makeup and brushes and sponge in the other side, and between takes I was basically redoing our makeup,” Winslet said.</p><p>The romantic moment ends with Jack and Rose kissing while feeling the breeze of the ocean air in their hair. But Winslet said that kissing DiCaprio “was not all it’s cracked up to be.”</p><p>“So we kept doing this kiss and I have a lot of pale makeup, and I would have to do makeup checks on both of us between takes,” Winslet explained. “And I would end up looking as though I had been sucking a caramel chocolate bar after each take because his makeup would come off on me. And he just looked like there was a bit missing from his face because there was a big pale bit from all my makeup getting onto him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kate-Winslet-Says-Titanic-Kiss-with-Leonardo-DiCaprio-Was-Such-a-Mess-2.jpg><p>“Oh God, it was such a mess,” she concluded.</p><p>Despite being difficult to film, Winset is “proud” of the scene — and Titanic as a whole — because “it’s that film that just keeps giving.”</p><p>In a separate interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> published on Wednesday, Winslet and Titanic director <strong>James Cameron</strong> <a href=#>addressed speculation</a> that they feuded at the time of the movie’s 1997 release.</p><p>In April 1997, the actress told the <a href=# rel=noopener>Los Angeles Times</a>: “You’d have to pay me a lot of money to work with Jim again.” The Times noted that Winslet “suffered hypothermia and nearly drowned twice” and contemplated leaving the movie.</p><p>Cameron told Variety that “there was never a rift between us,” adding, “She had a little postpartum depression when she let go of Rose. She and I have talked about the fact that she goes really, really deep, and her characters leave a lasting, sometimes dramatic impression on her.”</p><p>“There’s a part of me that feels almost sad that stupid, speculative Titanic stuff at the time overshadowed the actual relationship I have with him,” Winslet told the outlet. “He knows I will be up for anything. Any challenge, any piece of direction you give me? I’ll try it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/James-Cameron-Kate-Winslet.jpg><p>Winslet and Cameron recently reunited on Cameron’s Avatar sequel, <a href=#>Avatar: The Way of Water</a>, which was released in December 2022 and is now the third highest-grossing movie at the global box office (surpassing Titanic for the spot).</p><p>Winslet will reprise her role as Na’vi free driver Ronal in the next Avatar movie, which is set for release on December 19, 2025.</p><p>“I’m in the cutting room now, and I work with her performance every day,” Cameron told Variety.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While promoting The Way of Water, Winslet said she had a much more pleasant experience working with Cameron, who she once said had a “temper like you wouldn’t believe,” on the sci-fi franchise than she did on Titanic.</p><p>“I loved doing Avatar with Jim — he is much more calm now,” she told the U.K.’s <a href=# rel>Sunday Times</a> in December 2022. “In those days there was no space for him to say, ‘It might not work.’ He had to make it work. There were all those conversations about this huge film, Titanic. I can’t imagine the pressure.”</p><p>“As we get older we learn how to say, ‘I made a mistake.’ We all get better at that, don’t we?” she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKarJVixKq60qWcrWWjlsa0edOiq5qmmZh6rLXSrGSwoaSdeq2xzqeYq5yfYrGqr8CpqaKnXayutHnSrpqhZZFiuqa%2F0mg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkate-winslet-says-titanic-kiss-with-leonardo-dicaprio-was-such-a-mess.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkate-winslet-says-titanic-kiss-with-leonardo-dicaprio-was-such-a-mess.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkate-winslet-says-titanic-kiss-with-leonardo-dicaprio-was-such-a-mess.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkate-winslet-says-titanic-kiss-with-leonardo-dicaprio-was-such-a-mess.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkate-winslet-says-titanic-kiss-with-leonardo-dicaprio-was-such-a-mess.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkate-winslet-says-titanic-kiss-with-leonardo-dicaprio-was-such-a-mess.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./welcome-hotel.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./welcome-hotel.html>Welcome Hotel, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France Review</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./karolina-kurkova-19840228-html.html>Karolina Kurkova (Model) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./karolina-kurkova-19840228-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
