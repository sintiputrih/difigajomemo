<time>11 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>TAMPA, FLORIDA: <a href=# rel>WWE legend</a> who helped make the wrestling federation prominent, <a href=# rel>Hulk Hogan</a>, is allegedly paralyzed at the moment. The pro wrestler recently underwent another back surgery. Fellow icon Kurt Angle revealed on his podcast, "He [Hulk] can't feel anything. So now he can't feel his legs. So he has to walk with a cane which is, you know, that’s pretty serious, man." Now, previous claims from Hogan's daughter, Brooke Hogan, have revealed that the WWE star has undergone 25 surgeries throughout his life.&nbsp;</p><p>The 69-year-old pro wrestler has had a glorious career. He has won 12 World Titles 6 with WCW and 6 with WWE. However, it did not come easily. Hogan had to put his body through extreme stress and literally break every bone to get everything. His daughter reveals the struggle he has had with his body. <a href=# rel>Brooke Hogan</a> tells Dan Holt and Adam Glyn, hosts of '<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hollywood Raw</a>' podcast, that her father had 25 surgeries throughout his career. Brooke says, "We counted how many surgeries he’s had in the last 10 years and I think we’re at 25. He’s had both shoulders scoped and he had his whole bicep and his bursa sac and everything tied up in his shoulder last year." She calls it a "disaster." Brooke continues, "He got MRSA and it was like a big thing. So we had to go back and undo tons of physical therapy."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Is Hulk Hogan paralyzed?

She told the hosts, "He’s had both of his knees replaced multiple times, I think twice on both. He’s had his hips done. He’s had his elbow scope. So yeah, he’s had so many surgeries, so he’s done a ton, but this last one that he just had finally was like the winning ticket. So right now, he’s feeling great. He’s working out two hours in the gym every day. He’s still chugging along. Our family has been through a lot of crap, and I will say, my dad, it’s hard to have all your skeletons pulled out of your closet and just waved in front of everybody’s face and humiliated to the world. And then our family just goes through all this stuff."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/8579677b-3e60-4e7e-ab0b-f3ee81a0a1c0.1179076923><h2 class=split>Who is Brooke Hogan?</h2><p>Born to Hulk Hogan and Linda Claridge on May 5, 1988, Brooke is a television personality, singer, and actress. She has also served as an on-screen personality for Impact Wrestling. She took an early interest in music and released her first studio album titled 'Undiscovered' in 2006. It was preceded by the single 'About Us', which even entered the top-forty of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. With the Hogans working closely with VH1 and seeing a rating success, they began a reality television series called 'Hogan Knows Best' which aired from 2005 to 2007. She then got her own television series called 'Brooke Knows Best' which concluded in 2009.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/94f77946-644f-41e7-a5f1-1ddf6a2ba897.968585046><p>Her career in music soon came to an end after her second studio album, 'The Redemption', released in 2009, failed to match the expectations. Brooke tried her luck in acting once again by making appearances in several low-budget films and television shows. She then signed on to appear in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) but that also lasted only a year. In 2012, Brooke was seen in 'L.A. Slasher' and worked on two extended plays consisting of country music in 2015 and 2018.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Hulk Hogan's crumbling health</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/8047a928-35f7-4d99-9fd8-354c5e20bd1d.51236462><p>Kurt Angle further explains on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">'The Kurt Angle Show'</a>, "He had the nerves cut from his lower body, he can’t feel his lower body. So, he has to use his cane to walk around. I thought he was using the cane because he has pain in his back. He doesn’t have any pain, he has nothing at all." This news comes at a time when the WWE world is preparing for its biggest event Wrestlemania where WWE veterans are expected to make a comeback and rock the crowd. Angle continues, "He put his heart and soul into the business and ate him up. He's the name and face of the company. He's the guy that revolutionized pro wrestling. I have so much respect for him."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKGspaNdnbyorc2sZJ2ZpZy1tbHRZpmrp5%2Bgsm6%2FyKeenqpdqK66v4ywqZ6rpKGys3nDmptmrZ6ZsrPDxKerZqyfqa6tec6fZGttXajCs7PEq6Ceqw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-hulk-hogans-daughter-brooke-singer-says-wrestler-dad-underwent-total-of-25-surgeries.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-hulk-hogans-daughter-brooke-singer-says-wrestler-dad-underwent-total-of-25-surgeries.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-hulk-hogans-daughter-brooke-singer-says-wrestler-dad-underwent-total-of-25-surgeries.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-hulk-hogans-daughter-brooke-singer-says-wrestler-dad-underwent-total-of-25-surgeries.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-hulk-hogans-daughter-brooke-singer-says-wrestler-dad-underwent-total-of-25-surgeries.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-hulk-hogans-daughter-brooke-singer-says-wrestler-dad-underwent-total-of-25-surgeries.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-neil-bhatt-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-neil-bhatt-dating.html>Who is Neil Bhatt Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./shigeki-morimoto.html>Shigeki Morimoto - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./shigeki-morimoto.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
