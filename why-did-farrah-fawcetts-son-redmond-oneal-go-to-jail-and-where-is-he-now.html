It was neither an easy nor idyllic one as his parents’ relationship was regularly volatile. His father, O’Neal, regularly used drugs and his mother, Fawcett, would often drink to cope with her problems in Hollywood.</p><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true>Once, Ryan O’Neal even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shot at Redmon’s half-brother</a> Griffin, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">purposely missing</a> yet adding to a backlog of traumatic memories for Redmond and his family. Regrettably, Redmond learned bad habits from his parents and has an arrest record to prove it. He was arrested in 2008 for a DUI and drug possession. In 2011, he was arrested for heroin possession and in 2015, he violated his probation and was sentenced to three years in jail, eventually being released in 2016.</p><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=207 data-injectable=false>Redmond often blamed his disorderly childhood for his crimes and addictions. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RadarOnline</a>, he even said the mere reality of having celebrity parents put an unfair burden on his shoulders:</p><p>“It’s not the drugs that have been a problem, it’s the psychological trauma of my entire life — my whole life experiences have affected me the most. Fighting with my father, being kicked out and living on the streets, going to jail, being put in a psychiatric ward, being embarrassed all the time, just because of who my parents are. The pressure that came with that set off a time-bomb in my head. I never asked for any of this, I never wanted any attention.”</p><h2 id=h-redmond-s-arrests-and-legal-troubles data-injectable=false>Redmond’s arrests and legal troubles</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>Redmond’s bad behavior caught up with him in 2018. That year, he robbed a 7-Eleven and when he was detained for that crime, it was discovered Redmond was also involved in a spree of attacks in the Palms and Venice Beach areas, in which he stabbed a number of random people.</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=134 data-injectable=false>Five people were attacked, two of which were seriously injured.&nbsp; The LAPD spoke to <a href=#>US Weekly </a>about the 7-Eleven robbery, saying:</p><p>“The suspect entered the store with a knife and approached the clerk and demanded money from the register. The suspect fled store on foot … officers found the knife and cash in [O’Neal’s] possession.”</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>Redmond was arrested on May 8, 2018, and charged with one count of attempted murder, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, one count of criminal threats, one count of brandishing a knife, and one count of battery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>In October of 2019, Redmond was ruled mentally “incompetent” to stand trial by a commissioner. He was transferred from the Twin Towers jail in downtown Los Angeles to the California Department of State Hospitals Metropolitan location in Norwalk, California, in December of 2019. Redmond was diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and antisocial personality disorder.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where is Redmond O’Neal today?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Redmond-ONeal-.jpg><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>There have been scant details of Redmond’s life after he was admitted to the state psychiatric hospital in 2019 for his mental illness.
