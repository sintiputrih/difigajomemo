<time>20 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Thomas Edward Sizemore, better known as Tom Sizemore is an American Actor born on the 29th day of November 1961 in Detroit, Michigan. Despite acting in reputable titles, Tom Sizemore&nbsp;Net Worth comes into question as a consequence of the ultimate decision to be made in his life.</p><h2><strong>Tom Sizemore Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Tom Sizemore has a Net Worth of approximately $500,000.</p><h3><strong>Tom Sizemore Health</strong></h3><p>The American Actor is in the limelight once again with the state of his health being discussed. Tom Sizemore suffered a Brain Aneurysm at the age of 61 years. Through his Manager, Charles Lago, Tom Sizemore’s life is on the line as he reported that “there is nothing more to be done”.</p><p>Tom Sizemore’s health has deteriorated and the hard decision of euthanizing him is on the table. It is from this that the topic of his Net Worth stems as his family asked the public for space as ‘they decide the end of life matters.’</p><p>As unfortunate as it is, Tom Sizemore’s health is arguable a result of his lifestyle choices. The renowned Actor is publicly known to be a struggling addict of narcotic drugs. He has been placed in an induced coma.</p><p><strong>Also Read: -&nbsp;<a href=#>Kyle Dubas Net Worth</a></strong></p><h3><strong>Tom Sizemore Addiction</strong></h3><p>Tom Sizemore appeared as himself in the 2009-2010 television show on Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew and Celebrity Rehab Presents Sober House. In this show, the Actor is seen undergoing the processes in Rehab. He admitted to being addicted to Heroin and Crystal Meth.</p><p>In his autobiography, ‘Some Miracle I Made It Out’ Tom Sizemore describes his introduction to drugs and explains his experience with drugs. His substance abuse problems date back to the early 2000s.</p><p>He has attributed his addiction to his troubled and failed relationships with his ex-wives. The journey to his sobriety sees him remorseful for his behavior as he recovered from his anger management issues.</p><h3><strong>Tom Sizemore Career</strong></h3><p><strong><img alt="Tom Sizemore Net Worth" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/savedaughters.com/public/ckimages/ck_1677667220.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></strong></p><p>The Actor has had an exceptional career as an Actor. Tom Sizemore joined the Industry in the late 80s making his mark in blockbuster movies for over 30 years. He has been nominated and awarded different titles for best actor and best supporting actor. In 2022, he won the award for best-supporting actor and best ensemble cast in the Hollywood Blood Horror Festival Awards for Amber Road.</p><p>In 2001, he was part of the cast of Pearl Habour alongside Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and Cuba Gooding. The romantic war drama film was directed by Michael Bay. Another successful show, in which Tom Sizemore had a role in, is Justice League Unlimited (2004-2006). Tom Sizemore has had equally acclaimed roles in recent viewings like Shooter (2016-2018), Lucifer (2016-2021), Twin Peaks (2017), and Netflix’s Cobra Kai.</p><p>Despite his long-standing career as an Actor, Tom Sizemore has mismanaged his fortune after finding himself spending frivolously funding his drug habit, attending anger management classes, checking into rehab, several times and even defending legal allegations brought against him. Tom Sizemore’s Net Worth has definitely been affected by this.</p><p><strong>Also Read: -&nbsp;<a href=#>Mattias Ekholm Wife</a></strong></p><h3><strong>Tom Sizemore Family</strong></h3><p><strong><img alt="Tom Sizemore Net Worth" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/savedaughters.com/public/ckimages/ck_1677667238.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></strong></p><p>The 61-year-old Actor is the son of Thomas Edward Sizemore Snr. and Judith Schannault. With his father as a lawyer and philosophy professor and his mother as an Ombudsman Staff of the City of Detroit, Thomas Sizemore had all the advantages and support he needed to pursue an Acting career.</p><p>In 1996 at 35 years, Tom Sizemore got married to Maeve Quinlan for the first time. His first marriage was short-lived as he got divorced shortly after. Thereafter he got married a second time and got twice divorced in 1999. He has two progeny, aged 18 from his partner Janelle McIntire, who stand to inherit a share of his Net Worth.</p><p>Thomas Sizemore never married again after his two failed marriages but is known to have a lifetime partner in Janelle McIntire. Again, his drug problem is said to have been the cause of the rift between him and his romantic partners.</p><h3><strong>Tom Sizemore Wiki</strong></h3><p><strong>Early Life:-&nbsp;</strong>Born in Detroit Michigan, Tom Sizemore was raised Roman Catholic and went to Wayne State University and Temple University.</p><table border=1><tbody readability=2><tr><td></td><td><p>Tom Sizemore</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Age</p></td><td><p>61 years</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Date of Birth</p></td><td><p>29th November 1961</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Profession</p></td><td><p>Actor</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Nationality</p></td><td><p>American</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Net Worth</p></td><td><p>$500,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Children</p></td><td><p>2</p></td></tr><tr readability=3><td><p>Parents</p></td><td readability=5><p>Thomas Sizemore Snr. and Judith Schannault</p></td></tr><tr readability=3><td><p>Wives</p></td><td readability=5><p>Maeve Quinlan and Janelle McIntire</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>Latest News</strong></h3><p>Before his health problems came along, Tom Sizemore had been teaching Actors in Santa Monica, Los Angeles.
