What better way to give back to your parents who sacrificed so much for you than by buying them the house of their dreams? These celebs tend to agree.</p><h2 id=zayn-malik><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Zayn Malik</span></h2><p>While <a href=#>Zayn Malik</a> is most known for being Gigi Hadid's baby daddy these days, he was once a member of the world's biggest boy band, One Direction.

While he didn't have the amount of money that he has today, he still used what he had for his mom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=travis-scott><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Travis Scott</span></h2><p>Rapper <a href=#>Travis Scott</a> has said many times that his family had it tough while he was growing up.

Once he eventually hit it big, he decided to give back to his father by buying him a $850,000 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">house</a> located in Ontario, Canada. The house was for his dad along with his half-brother and half-sister, Jaxson and Jazmyn. While he was raised by his mother, Justin still has a close relationship with his dad and wanted to make sure that he was taken care of too.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Taylor Swift</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> is one of the most famous musicians in the world, but she didn't get that way over night. Taylor has worked hard since she was a teen to become a successful musican, and with the help of her parents she was able to get to the level of fame that she has today. To say thank you for all that they've done, Taylor bought her parents a beautiful <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mansion</a> worth $2.5 million located in Nashville, Tennessee.

In a twist, though, Michael actually lived in the house with his parents for four years until he finally decided to move out in late 2020. Buying them a house and then living with them was a way to not only give back but also to stay close to them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pete-davidson><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Pete Davidson</span></h2><p>Saturday Night Live star <a href=#>Pete Davidson</a> is so close to his mom.

He posted a video of her getting her present on social media, and you could see the pure joy on both of their faces.</p><h2 id=rihanna><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Rihanna</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Rihanna</a> has come so far since she was just a kid growing up on the island of Barbados.
