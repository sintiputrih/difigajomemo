The former Posh Spice has gone on to make a <a class=hm-link href=#>name for herself in the fashion world</a>, and David has since had an endless slew of projects and campaigns off the back of his unbelievable sporting career.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/98d88621be83-victoria-david-leather-catsuits.jpg><p id=e_MnPYcHxOG data-wc=28>Along with all of this success has come a substantial fortune, so join HELLO! as we explore David and Victoria Beckham's net worth, annual earnings, and real estate.</p><h2 dir=ltr>What is David and Victoria's total net worth?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eFddEyFhG39 data-wc=21>According to Celebrity Net Worth, the husband-and-wife duo have a combined net worth of $450 million, a staggeringly eye-watering<strong>&nbsp;£362 million.</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>How does the former football star make money?&nbsp;</h2><h3 dir=ltr>His impeccable football career&nbsp;</h3><p id=e8PxGvP0MRZ data-wc=81>The Leytonstone-born star is one of Britain's best exports and most recognised footballers in the world. He started playing professionally when he was 17 with Manchester United and in 2001, David signed a £16million contract to remain with the club for another three years. But in 2003, he ended up signing an even more lucrative deal with Real Madrid. David went on to make history in 2007 when he joined LA Galaxy, earning a reported £753,000 per week for five years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0c3aedff7ce9-gettyimages-492933195.jpg><p id=etDJk4wAE6P data-wc=77>The sports legend, who has been named FIFA World Player of the Year twice, has played for several other teams including AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain. Aside from his league career, David was also named captain of the England national football team in 2000. He retained that title for six years. David retired in 2013, but his money didn't dry up. Far from it; he raked in £49 million two years later, thanks to his brand endorsements.</p><h3 dir=ltr>Countless endorsement deals</h3><p id=e9LC2SB3rqZ data-wc=78>David has been the face of dozens of advertising campaigns and sponsorships, promoting the likes of Adidas, Coty, Brylcreem, Armani, H&M, Sainsbury's, Samsung, Vodafone, Breitling, Pepsi, Calvin Klein and Gilette to name a few. His most recent commercial endorsements include whisky brand Haig and luxury watch brand Tudor. David also acted as a brand ambassador for Sky television and Sainsbury's. In 2004, he was named the highest-paid football player, after taking into account his salary and advertising deals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/38297d78e933-david-beckham-speech-inter-miami.jpg><h3>His football team Inter Miami</h3><p id=emtOgbp0bP8 data-wc=71>His latest football project has seen David <a class=hm-link href=#>buy his own Major League Soccer team</a> in Miami. The footballer announced the news in January 2018, saying it had been "a hell of a journey" and promising that "the team we will bring into the league will be the best team". David's business group Beckham Miami United bought a plot of land to build a new stadium, which has a 20,000 seating capacity.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6469e7bd014f-david-beckham-family-nashville.jpg><p id=e3IDaGItvT6 data-wc=139>In August 2018, the sports icon revealed that his Major League Soccer team will be called Club Internacional de Futbol Miami, or Inter Miami CF, and will make their MLS debut in 2020. David took to Instagram to share a photo of the crest, which features two herons and a sun with seven rays - a clear homage to the ex-England captain who wore the number seven when he played for Manchester United and England. David wrote: "Four years ago, we dreamt of a soccer club. Today, we're proud to announce the official name and crest of our new team, Club Internacional de Fútbol Miami. @intermiamicf @mls THIS IS US. THIS IS MIAMI." He added in another post: "We have spent so much time to make sure we got this right for our fans.. A Very proud moment @intermiamicf."</p><h3 dir=ltr>His own companies</h3><p id=e_LByR4iHEm data-wc=83>David has two companies that manage his wealth. According to The Sun, his companies made £71,000 a day in 2016. His business, Seven Global LLP, takes care of the sales from his clothing, accessory and fragrance commercial deals, while Footwork Productions is responsible for his name and image rights. Both companies sit under the umbrella of DB Ventures and DB Ventures' parent company, Beckham Brand Holdings Ltd, which David shares with his wife Victoria and the family's management group headed by Simon Fuller.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/544cd2924515-victoria-david-beckham-boat.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>How does the former Spice Girl make money?</h2><p id=epHdtZNSvH data-wc=37>Victoria earns per year will likely vary a lot depending on what work she does in addition to her work on her fashion brand. In the past, Victoria has done a considerable amount of advertisements and endorsements.</p><p id=etpnaK3GB8 data-wc=43>In 2003, the then-singer acted as the face of RocaWear for an undisclosed sum. In 2007, she starred alongside her Spice Girls bandmates for a Christmas Tesco advert which netted them £1million each.

The star released two collections for the brand which flew off the shelves in the 2010s, perhaps leading to her decision to<strong>&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>launch Victoria Beckham Beauty</a></strong> in 2019.</p><p id=e9OT9BBNj2R data-wc=47>Other work which has netted Victoria more earnings over the years includes her several book deals and appearances on documentaries and reality TV shows such as Being Victoria Beckham.

Most recently, her success was seen as she exhibited for <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>the second time</a></strong> at Paris Fashion Week in 2023.</p><p id=eGmiYJ3QhGq data-wc=55>However, Victoria's fashion label is not necessarily a high earner for the star. Over the past few years, news has come out revealing that since its launch in 2008, Victoria Beckham has actually lost rather than earned money, with Victoria, David and other shareholders having to intervene during the pandemic to keep the label afloat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/554366ca2f23-victoria-beckham.jpg><p id=eOAzCIyYXqb data-wc=24>However, a report from her brand's investor, David Belhassen, in March 2023 suggested that things might finally be on the up for the label.</p><h3>Their lavish property portfolio&nbsp;</h3><p id=eWUE_5fV40V data-wc=42>Despite some issues with her fashion label, thanks to Victoria and David's many successful projects, Brand Beckham have also owned an impressive amount of real estate over the years where they have lived with their four children: <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Brooklyn</a></strong>, <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Cruz</a></strong>, <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Romeo</a></strong>, and <strong><span>Harper</span></strong>.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>Inside the Beckhams' stunning homes</figure><p id=ec7-PNSeFyaZ data-wc=43>In 2003, when David was still a super in-demand footballer, the whole clan upped and moved to <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>a £5 million home</a></strong> near the Spanish capital after he was snapped up for a cool £25 million to play for the Spanish giants Real Madrid.</p><p id=eQi3Fc-kPg data-wc=44>Then in 2007, the Beckhams cemented their A-list status with <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>a hotly-anticipated move to Los Angeles</a></strong> after David had signed a contract with football team LA Galaxy.

Speaking to ES magazine in 2018, David said: "We used to be very extravagant in what we'd buy each other. But we're obviously saving the pennies now because we have so many children to be extravagant with." He added: "So it's the simple things, really. It's more about spending time together, going for a simple dinner together. Having a nice bottle of wine together."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7b756c30b439-beckham-family-xmas.jpg><p id=e4bd-U12VXQ data-wc=76>David has also previously shared his worries about his children growing up spoilt. He told The Times: "They've got a great life set up for them. Obviously, our boys and little girl are very lucky. But I think, as a parent, you always worry, 'Have they got that hunger that I had as a kid?'" The family man added: "We make sure that the most important thing to us is our family and we're all grounded."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=ekrZp7MuSYU data-wc=124>His wife Victoria, who also came from a modest background, has the same attitude. Speaking about the importance of working hard, the former Spice Girl said: "It's never been an option not to work hard. <a class=hm-link href=#>They see mummy go to work</a>, they see daddy go to work, and they go to school and they have to work. But at the same time they're happy children. I believe that children should be children, and have fun." Their eldest son Brooklyn has worked in a café, with Victoria revealing: "He's worked in the local café cleaning up dishes for the last two years, which I think is great. It's important that the kids have a good work ethic and try to help other people as well."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dnyVbnBxZ5SWw6qwjK%2BgnKyfp7aiecGemqSgkaJ6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdavid-victoria-beckham-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdavid-victoria-beckham-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdavid-victoria-beckham-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdavid-victoria-beckham-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdavid-victoria-beckham-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-victoria-beckham-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jason-drumheller-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-465896-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jason-drumheller-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-465896-html.html>Jason Drumheller Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-much-money-does-kenny-smith-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Kenny Smith Make?
