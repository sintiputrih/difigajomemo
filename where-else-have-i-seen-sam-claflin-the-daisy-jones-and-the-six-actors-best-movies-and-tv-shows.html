The film is a remarkable romantic comedy that will stay with you because of the story, and the chemistry between the two leads.

The original film hit the streaming service in 2020 and it was directed by Harry Bradbeer, while the sequel was released in 2022. It was based on the first book in The Enola Holmes Mysteries series of young adult novels that followed the younger sister of the famous detective, who in this film, is portrayed by Henry Cavill.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>Claflin plays the other Holmes brother in the movie, Mycroft Holmes. He takes in Enola in the film, and considers her a troublemaker, as opposed to Sherlock who finds her to be clever. Due to scheduling conflicts, Sam Claflin was unable to reprise his role for Enola Holmes 2. You can watch Enola Holmes on Netflix.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Snow White and the Huntsman</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>Claflin’s second major film was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Snow White and the Huntsman</a>, which was released in 2012. The film is a retelling of the classic Snow White tale by the Brothers Grimm. Directed by Rupert Sanders, the movie starred Kristen Stewart as Snow White herself, with Chris Hemsworth playing the role of the Huntsman. Charlize Theron plays the Evil Queen while Claflin plays William, Snow White’s childhood friend and love interest.</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>If you do not know the fairytale, the film follows Snow White and her quest to break free from the grasp of her evil stepmother Queen Ravenna, a sorceress. Along the way, she meets some dwarves and Eric the Huntsman, and together they beat the Evil Queen. You can stream Snow White and the Huntsman on FuboTV or buy it and rent it on Apple TV and Amazon Prime Video.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Huntsman: Winter’s War</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true>The sequel to our previous entry, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Huntsman: Winter’s War</a> was released in 2016 and was directed by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan. As it is a sequel, some of the characters from the first film returned, like Claflin’s William, the Huntsman, and the Evil Queen. In addition to those characters, Emily Blunt plays the Evil Queen’s sister, Queen Freya, while Jessica Chastain plays Sara, Eric’s wife who was thought to be dead.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>The sequel focuses on the couple discovering that they were both tricked, with Eric tricked into believing that Sara was dead and Sara tricked into believing that he did not care about her. Kristen Stewart does not reprise her role in the film, only appearing in archive footage, while Claflin reprises his role, although he is not in the majority of the film. You can rent or buy The Huntsman: Winter’s War on Apple TV or Amazon Prime Video.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Nightingale</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true>An Australian film, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Nightingale</a> was directed by Jennifer Kent. The movie was released in 2019 and it starred Aisling Franciosi as Clare, an Irish convict living in Tasmania in 1825, which was then known as Van Diemen’s Land. Claflin took on the role of the villain in the film, as he played Hawkins, a member of the Colonial forces.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>The movie was criticized for its use of graphic sexual violence, as it accurately depicts the racially motivated violence in Australia at that time.

The film is also available to rent or buy on Apple TV or Amazon Prime Video.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>Ironically, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</a> might have been the movie to spark Sam Claflin’s popularity. The second film in The Hunger Games franchise was directed by Francis Lawrence and was released in 2013. The main trio of the franchise all returned for the sequel, with Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark, and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=816 data-injectable=true>Catching Fire saw the two tributes be selected from previous champions of The Hunger Games, so Katniss and Peeta were forced to fight once again. Claflin plays Finnick Odair, who is one of the other tributes from District 4. At first, he seems untrustworthy before revealing himself to be a true ally to the main characters, aiding in their escape. You can stream The Hunger Games: Catching Fire on Amazon Prime Video.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Parts 1 and 2</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true>The last book in The Hunger Games franchise was split into two movies, but they make a good double feature so we are including them in the same entry. They were released in 2014 and 2015 and both were directed by Francis Lawrence. The first Part continues where Catching Fire left off, with the tributes going to District 13.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>Unlike the first two films, Mockingjay did not follow a group of teenagers fighting each other to survive, instead focusing on the war and battles between the Districts and the Capitol. Claflin’s role is much more interesting in these films, as Finnick reunites with his love after they manage to infiltrate the Capitol. Part 1 and Part 2 can be rented or bought on Apple TV and Amazon Prime Video while Part 2 is available to stream on the latter service.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Peaky Blinders</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true>Led by Cillian Murphy, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peaky Blinders</a> — the only series on this list — follows a gang of men who are active in Birmingham after WWI. It is a period crime drama, and over the years Tom Hardy, Sam Neill, Helen McCrory, Adrien Brody, and Anya Taylor-Joy have all appeared in it. Claflin plays Oswald Mosley, one of the main antagonists of the show.</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>Mosley is the leader of the British Union of Fascists, which grew in power as the Nazi Party grew in power in Germany prior to WWII.

All six seasons of Peaky Blinders are available to stream on Netflix.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Last Night in Soho</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>Edgar Wright directed the horror film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Last Night in Solo</a>, which was released in 2021. The film followed Ellie Turner (Thomasin McKenzie) who moves to London to study fashion, where she quickly becomes isolated. After finding a room for rent, she begins to experience dreams that she is Sandie Collins (Anya Taylor-Joy), an aspiring performer in the 1960s. Things begin to turn when she discovers that Sandie might have been killed.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>The movie also stars Matt Smith, Terence Stamp, and Diana Rigg. Claflin was not in the film long, as he briefly played the younger version of a character who Ellie interacts with, in the present day. But, his role was memorable nonetheless as he played it well.
