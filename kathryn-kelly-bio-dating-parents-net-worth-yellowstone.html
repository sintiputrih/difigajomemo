So, here we cover details on her parents, boyfriend, daughter, dating life, and net worth.</p><p>So, tag along with this Kathryn Kelly Bio to learn more about ‘Yellowstone’ actress.</p><h3><strong>Is Yellowstone Actress Kathryn Kelly Dating Anyone?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Kathryn Kelly might be in a relationship. Although she hasn’t revealed the name of her alleged beau, the mystery man has appeared on Facebook of Kathryn’s mother. Kathryn and her alleged mystery man attended her grandmother Helen Coleman’s birthday party together. Kathryn’s mom shared a few pictures of the two.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kathryn-Kelly-Boyfriend-300x297.jpg><p>But as of this writing, the Yellowstone actress hasn’t spoken about her relationship with the man. But, the fact that Kathryn has introduced him to her family suggests that the relationship might be quite serious. Furthermore, she is yet to introduce her lover to the world or make their relationship IG official.</p><p>We expect to learn about her man, how they met, and for how long they have dated each other after that.</p><h3><strong>Has Kathryn Kelly Spoken About Her Former Boyfriend?</strong></h3><p>As implied, Kathryn Kelly is very private when it comes to her relationships. She hasn’t opened up about her past relationships as of this writing.</p><p>But, we know from her social media posts that Kathryn has a daughter named Sophia Kelly with her previous boyfriend. Her daughter is frequently featured on her social media.</p><p>Sophia Kelly turned 7 years old on 12 September 2021.

Kathryn’s mother shared a short story about her parents on her Facebook which was dedicated to Kathryn’s paternal grandfather Joe Dickerson Sr. She wrote, “Dating my husband (in Atlanta) after our UT Knoxville school days meant I didn’t know his family well at all. On visits to Knoxville– which were overnighters, of course, I found to break the nerves of awkwardness… I would just dive into whatever they were doing around the house and help out. It was my way to connect and have a conversation about things they were interested in such as his workshop or her cooking or his birdfeeder refills…etc.”</p><p>She continued, “One day Joe P. slung his arm around my shoulders and said… “Do you know what I like about you? You are a Do-er! I like that. That’s a good thing.”I thought hmmm … well good! hahaha, I’ve thought about that many times since. I can now recognize the doers in the world and find myself wanting to line up with those people!!”</p><p>Kathryn lost her paternal grandfather a while back but hasn’t revealed anything about him.</p><p>As for her mom, Susan Dickerson currently works as a health, wellness, nutritional cleansing coach and entrepreneur at Isagenix.

In 2012, Susan explained on her Facebook that “Going to the movies” has always been her passion. Also, she loved seeking “sets” to get inside and look behind the scenes has always been a fascination of her.</p><p>From the first time Susan set foot on location at Universal Studios, CA in 1983 with her family, she was taken by the fact that she was seeing the real “Gilligan’s Island”, the street from “Leave it to Beaver” and the house it was filmed. She never saw a TV show or film the same way.</p><p>Then, she explained that her daughter Kathryn has started her career working in the movies in 2012. She explained that Kathryn made it fun on a whole new level and even more exciting with her study and pursuit of film/on-camera acting.</p><p>Susan wrote, “I’m beginning to enjoy “movie going” at a whole new level after experiencing what goes on through her studies, auditions and “jobs” on set as well as having a built-in “movie-going lover” in the house. Getting to know film directors, casting directors, agents, photographers, fellow actors and parents who have been in support of this “dream”…has brought a whole new level of appreciation in realizing what it takes to bringing a creative thought to paper to the camera to the screen.”</p><p>Kathryn grew up in Atlanta, Georgia where she currently lives. She studied acting and theatre since 14 years old and has successfully worked in the commercial, film, and print division with Houghton Talent Agency since 2011.
